JONES All right!  I've had enough of this shit!  You want meat, motherfucker?  Come on, eat me, sucker, try some dark meat! 
He pushes away from the group despite Beck's attempt to stop him. 
JONES(cont'd) (taunting sharks) What's wrong you snout-nosed bastards?  My meat too tough for you?! 
Amazingly the sharks begin to disappear.  Willie and Beck watch stunned.  Even Jones is surprised. 
JONES(cont'd) (to Willie and Beck) Whoa!  Did you see those fools run?  They know whose boss. 
He jabs his arm upward in triumph and for the first time WE SEE a gash across his forearm. 
UNDERWATER POV 
As Jones crows triumphantly, WE SUDDENLY SEE HIS WET SUIT RIPPING ALONG HIS THIGHS! 
SURFACE/OCEAN 
Jones is chortling, suddenly his smile vanishes, something is happening... 
WE hear the DRONE OF THE APPROACHING HELICOPTER...THUMP, THUMP, THUMP...The blades of the helicopter sound out over the waves.  It's lights are visible.  Willie and Beck wave frantically as Jones drifts closer to them! 
UNDERWATER 
JONES' LEGS  His wet suit is now completely split open and WE SEE THE BLACK SCALES SPREADING! 
THE HELICOPTER 
hovers over the group below and lands on the water.  Its blades beat the surface into waves.  The WINCH OPERATOR hurls out a rescue harness and Beck helps Willie into the ring.  He CLICKS the fastener and suddenly they both lock eyes.  Before Willie can say anything Beck falls back and signals the Winch operator who begins hauling her to safety. Immediately Beck locks back at Jones and extends his arm. 
BECK Jonesy...Give me your hand! 
WILLIE reaches the helicopter and quickly climbs out of the harness.  The Winch operator throws it back across the water where 
BECK grabs the harness. 
BECK C'mon, Jones! 
Jones reaches out his hand.  He is almost there WHEN SUDDENLY RISING OUT OF THE WATER BEHIND THEM IS THE SIXPACK/BOWMAN CREATURE IN ALL ITS HIDEOUS GLORY!  HUGE AND GRUESOME, ITS LONG TEETH GLIMMER IN THE LIGHT.  IT GOES FOR BECK BUT JONES MOVES BETWEEN THEM. 
BECK Jonesy, No! 
JONES Get out of here, Becky! 
The Creature grabs Jones and pulls him violently under. Beck watches horrified as his friend disappears.  Numbed he clips the rescue harness around him when suddenly, WE SEE a boiling of water where Jones disappeared...bubbles rising...and then Jones' bloody and tattered life vest bobs to the surface several feet away from Beck. 
Beck reaches out for it just as the Creature appears again! It turns and focuses on Beck.  Beck keeps going for the life vest as the Creature starts for him. 
ON HELICOPTER 
The Winch operator and Willie watch in horror as the Creature bears down on Beck. 
WINCH OPERATOR Is he in the harness! 
CLOSE ON JONES' TATTERED VEST  Beck reaches it.  His fingers wrap around the bicycle pump-like, seismic tool in Jones' vest pocket.  The Creature is right on top of him! 
CHUNK, CHUNK, Beck cocks it like a pump shotgun as tentacles rise wickedly out of the water and wrap around Beck's body in a death grip.  It's horrible mouth starts to open. 
BECK C'mon, motherfucker open up! 
The Creature's mouth widens and as it starts to strike Beck thrusts the seismic tool into its gaping maw and is suddenly pulled from behind--out of the creature's grasp!  The rescue cable is taut!  The helicopter is taking off! 
BECK'S POV/ RISING SHOT.  Beck rises suddenly out of the water, the Creature growing instantly smaller below him until BOOM! the Seismic device explodes in the Sixpack/Bowman Creature, blowing it to bits across the ocean surface!  The shock wave sends the helicopter banking off toward the ship with Beck safely attached by cable below it. The winch operator pulls him in. 
EXT. COAST GUARD SHIP - LATER 
Beck, dressed now in crisp white clothes, stands on deck of the ship.  He glances occasionally at a door nearby marked INFIRMARY, then looks up as the Captain approaches and shakes his hand. 
CAPTAIN Mr. Beck, I understand you passed your physical with flying colors.  And Ms. Williams? 
BECK (worried) I don't know yet, she's still in there.
