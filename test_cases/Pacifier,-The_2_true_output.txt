Serb 1 rushes out, shouting orders: He alerts four ARMED GUARDS and the Jet Ski drivers (now our Seals). 
SERBIAN 1 Something must be below us! Shoot! Shoot! 
The Armed Guards fire relentlessly into the water. Serb 2 rushes below deck. 
INT. SHIP'S HOLD - CONTINUOUS 
PROFESSOR CHARLES PLUMMER, bound to a chair and gagged, tries to YELP as the room begins to flood with water. 
INT. SHIP'S CORRIDOR - SIMULTANEOUS 
Serb 2 runs down steps to the lowermost hold. He tries to force the door open. When it finally opens, he is forced back by a three foot wall of water. 
INT. SHIP'S HOLD - CONTINUOUS 
Professor Plummer panics, as the water rises up to his mouth He struggles, but can't get free. Up to his nose, over his head.... He's gone. 
Then Shane Wolf rises out of the water, hauling the Professor up. He cuts the Professor's GAG. Plummer screams. Shane removes his mouth piece. Shane doesn't seem the slightest bit fazed by the circumstances. 
SHANE Lieutenant Shane Wolfe, United States Navy. I'm gonna get you outta here. But you have to do exactly what I say, when I say it. My way -- no highway option. Do you copy? (Plummer nods, terrified.) Where's the briefcase? 
The Professor gestures across the room, where a metal BRIEFCASE is floating. Shane calmly HANDCUFFS it to his own waist. As the water rises, to the roof. 
PLUMMER How did you know where I... 
Shane sticks the mouth piece into Plummer's mouth, giving him his oxygen. 
EXT. ON THE DECK - SIMULTANEOUS 
The Armed Guards stop shooting into the water. One of our SEALS calls out to them, in PERFECT SERBIAN: 
SEAL KEEP SHOOTING! 
The Guards fire again. The SEAL speaks into his neck mic. 
SEAL (CONT'D) Give it a second, they're almost out of ammo. 
The Seal calls out: "shoot more, more!" They do, until there's nothing but empty CLICKS from their guns. 
SEAL (CONT'D) Now Lieutenant. Chopper's four meters at your 10 o'clock. 
INT. SHIP'S HOLD - CONTINUOUS 
Just before the water envelopes him and Plummer... 
SHANE (into his mic) I've got the Prof and the case. First round's on me back at Virginia Beach. 
Shane takes a deep breath, and pulls himself, the Professor and the briefcase UNDER the water. 
EXT. OCEAN'S SURFACE - MOMENTS LATER 
Shane and the Professor rise to the surface as the boat falters behind them. Shane pulls out a retractable CROSSBOW. It clicks open and he shoots a CABLE into the belly of the helicopter above him. 
SHANE Hold on. 
INT. HELICOPTER - A SECOND LATER 
Shane appears at the Pilot's door, holding the Professor. Shane addresses the Pilot in perfect SERBIAN. 
SHANE You know how to swim? 
The Pilot nods, terrified. Shane TOSSES the Pilot out. 
Shane swings into the hot seat and grabs the controls, pulling the Professor in behind him. 
ON THE SURFACE OF THE WATER - CONTINUOUS 
The SEALS on the Jet Skis SALUTE Shane in the chopper, then disappear gracefully back into the water. 
INT. HELICOPTER - CONTINUOUS 
Shane smiles, clearly he loves this kind of day. He looks beside him, the Professor looks terrified. The Professor takes out his mouth piece. 
PLUMMER Oh my God. I can't believe you... how'd we... That was the most incredible... 
Shane sticks the mouth piece back in the Professors' mouth, shutting him up. 
SHANE Better keep that on `til we get to the rendezvous point. 
PLUMMER (through the mouth piece) Why? Poison gas? 
SHANE (re: the oxygen) No. I'm just not big on chit chat.
