BEING JOHN MALKOVICH 
A Screenplay by Charlie Kaufman 
INT. CHEERLESS ROOM - DAY 
The room is bare, dusty. A ceiling fan turns. The wall clock ticks. Craig, 30 years old and small, sits at a collapsible card table. The only item on the table is a book. Craig picks it up, looks at the jacket. It's entitled "Sit." Craig opens the book. It reads: "sit sit sit sit sit..." over and over, page after page. Craig closes the book. He begins to stand, but thinks better of it, sighs. He looks at the book again. It is now entitled "Die."  He opens it up.  "die die die die die..."  A rooster crows. 
CUT TO: 
INT. CRAIG AND LOTTE'S BEDROOM - MORNING 
Craig jolts awake. A rooster stands on Craig's chest, crowing. Lotte, also 30, in the middle of dressing for work, hurries in and pulls the bird from Craig's chest. 
LOTTE Sorry, hon. I didn't know Orrin Hatch was out of his pen. Good morning. 
Lotte leans down and kisses Craig on the forehead. 
CRAIG Morning. 
LOTTE Gotta run. Shipment of grub worms coming in first thing. 
CRAIG Enjoy. 
LOTTE Craig, listen, honey, I've been thinking... maybe you'd feel better if you got, you know, a job or something. 
CRAIG We've been over this. Nobody's looking for a puppeteer in today's wintry economic climate. 
LOTTE Well, you know, maybe something else until this whole puppet thing turns around. 
CRAIG (bitterly) The Great Mantini doesn't need a day job. 
LOTTE (sighs) Craig, everyone can't be Derek Mantini. (beat) Well, grub worms are waiting. Do me a favor? 
CRAIG What? 
LOTTE Would you check in on Elijah? He seems to be a little under the weather this morning. 
CRAIG Which one is Elijah again? 
LOTTE The monkey. 
CRAIG Yeah. Okay. 
CUT TO: 
INT. CRAIG AND LOTTE' S GARAGE - MORNING 
The place is a mess. Vivaldi blasts through cheap speakers. A small marionette stage stands in the back of the garage. The stage is lit and on it is a finely sculpted puppet version of Craig. The "Craig" puppet paces back and forth, wringing its hands with incredible subtlety. We see Craig, above and behind the stage. He is manipulating the puppet. His fingers move fast and furious. The puppet breaks into a dance, a beautiful and intricate balletic piece. Soon the puppet is leaping and tumbling through space, moves that one would think impossible for a marionette. Sweat appears on the real Craigs brow. His fingers move like lightning. The puppet moves faster and faster. Sweat appears on the puppet's brow. We see that the sweat is being piped from a special device that the real Craig controls. The Craig puppet collapses on the floor of the stage. It puts its hands up to its face and weeps. Craig hangs the puppet, and comes down around the front of the stage. He is heaving. He switches off the music, picks up a beer and takes a swig. 
CUT TO: 
INT. CRAIG AND LOTTE'S LIVING ROOM - DAY 
The room is filled with penned and unpenned animals of all kinds: snakes, lizards, birds, a dog, cats, etc. Craig sits on the couch and looks at the want ads, the TV is on in the background. Elijah, the monkey, sits next to Craig holding his stomach and moaning weakly. On the TV, Derek Mantini is working a 60 foot high marionette from the top of a water tower. The assembled crowd is enthralled. 
TV ANNOUNCER The crowd is enthralled as Derek Mantini, arguably the greatest puppeteer in the history of the world, performs "The Belle of Amherst" with his 60 foot Emily Dickinson puppet, directed by the inimitable Charles Nelson Reilly. 
Charles Nelson Reilly floats by in a hot air balloon. 
CHARLES NELSON REILLY Beautiful, beautiful! Nyong-nyong. 
CRAIG Gimmicky bastard. 
Craig switches off the TV. He comes across an ad for a female puppeteer to teach at a girls school. Craig rubs his chin in thought, then stands with great determination.

CRAIG I'm a puppeteer. 
They drive in silence. 
CUT TO: 
INT. CRAIG AND LOTTE'S LIVING ROOM - MORNING 
Craig sits on the couch in his bathrobe and studies the want ads. He sees an ad for a company called "WOMYN-TEERS", looking for "an African-American, Lesbian Separatist Puppeteer for Community Outreach." Craig rubs his chin in thought, stands with determination. 
MUSIC IN: SAME AS BEFORE.

Craig pulls an afro-style wig off a mannequin head on Lotte's dressing table. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. STREET - MORNING 
Craig, now made up to look like a black, lesbian separatist, hails a cab. Women look at him longingly. 
CUT TO: 
INT. CAR - NIGHT 
Craig, dressed as the black lesbian and beaten to a pulp. sits in the passenger seat. Lotte drives. 
LOTTE (finally) Why, Craig. why? 
CRAIG (through fat lip) I... puppeteer. 
CUT TO: 
INT. CRAIG AND LOTTE'S LIVING ROOM - DAY 
Craig reads the paper. He comes across an ad: "Female puppeteer wanted for nudist colony marionette staging of 'Oh, Calcutta!'"  Craig rubs his chin. 
CUT TO: 
INT. CAR - NIGHT 
Craig sits in the passenger seat. He is made up as a woman and wears a full-body rubber "naked woman" suit. Lotte drives. 
LOTTE (finally) You know, maybe you should speak to someone about this. 
CUT TO: 
INT. CRAIG AND LOTTE' S LIVING ROOM - DAY 
Craig sees a personal ad: "Male puppeteer looking for attractive female puppeteer for friendship, travel, and much much more."  Craig rubs his chin, then thinks better of it and sighs. He finds a want ad calling for a "short-statured file clerk with unusually nimble and dexterous fingers needed for speed filing."  Craig writes down the address. 
CUT TO: 
INT. OFFICE BUILDING LOBBY - DAY 
Craig. in sport coat and tie, studies the business listings board. He finds LesterCorp, and sees that it is located on floor 7 1/2. Craig presses the elevator button and waits. Another man comes and waits next to him. The doors open, and Craig and the other man get in. 
CUT TO: 
INT. ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS 
The other man presses "9." Craig studies the buttons. There is no "7 1/2." 
WOMAN #1 Seven and a half, right? 
CRAIG Uh. yeah. 
WOMAN #1 I'll take you through it. 
LESTER (crafty) You think so, eh? Which comes first, L or... Glooph? 
CRAIG Glooph is not a letter, sir. 
LESTER Damn, you are good. I tried to trick you. Okay, put these in order. 
Lester hands Craig a bunch of index cards. Craig orders them with amazing speed and dexterity. Lester watches, eyes wide. 
LESTER (CONT'D) (flips intercom switch) Floris, get Guinness on the phone. 
FLORIS (O.S.) Gehginnis ondah foam? 
LESTER Forget it. 
FLORIS (CONT'D) Fork ah did? 
LESTER (flips off switch) Fine woman, Floris. I don't know how she puts up with this damn speech impediment of mine. 
CRAIG You don't have a speech impediment, Dr. Lester. 
LESTER Flattery will get you everywhere, my boy. But I'm afraid I have to trust Floris on this one. You see, she has her doctorate in speech impedimentology from Case Western. Perhaps you've read her memoirs, "I can't understand a word any of you are saying." 
CRAIG No. 
LESTER Pity, it tells it like it is. That's why the eastern, read Jewish, publishing establishment won't touch it. That's a quote from the book jacket. George Will, I think. (beat) I apologize if you can't understan a word I'm saying, Dr. Schwartz. 
CRAIG No. I understand perfectly. 
LESTER (choking up) Thank you for being kind enough to lie. You see, I've been very lonely in my isolated tower of indecipherable speech. You're hired. Any questions? 
CRAIG Just one. Why is this floor so short? 
LESTER Low overhead, m'boy. We pass the savings on to you. (laughs heartily) But seriously, that's all covered in orientation. 
CUT TO: 
INT. ORIENTATION ROOM - DAY 
It's a small screening room with red velvet seats. There are a few people scattered about the squat theater. Craig is among them. He looks around the room and his eyes rest momentarily on Maxine. She is in her late 20's with close cropped black hair. Her eyes are opaque, her face expressionless, her countenance trance-like. She glances over at Craig, then turns back to the screen. The lights dim. A projector whirs and the screen is illuminated. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. OFFICE BUILDING - DAY 
We tilt up the building. 
MUSIC:	Perky Industrial Film Music. 
TITLE:	The 7 1/2 Floor 
NARRATOR (0.S.) Welcome to the 7 1/2 floor of the Mertin-Flemmer building. As you will now be spending your work day here, it is important that you learn a bit about the history of this famous floor. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. 7 1/2 FLOOR - DAY 
Don and Wendy, two office workers, crouch in the hall and chat. Both hold cups of coffee. 
WENDY Hello, Don. 
DON Hello. Wendy. 
WENDY Don, I was wondering, do you know why our workplace has such low ceilings? 
DON It's an interesting story, Wendy. Many years ago in the late 1800's, James Mertin, an Irish ship captain looking to invest in the future of our great country, came to this town and decided to erect an office building. 
CUT TO: 
OLD FOOTAGE OF CONSTRUCTION CREW WORKING. 
DON (CONT'D) (V.0.) He would call this building the Mertin-Flemmer Building, after himself and someone else, who, local legend has it, was named Flemmer. 
CUT TO: 
INT. 19TH CENTURY OFFICE - DAY 
An actor playing Mertin sits at a desk and writes with aquill. He appears very stern and has mutton chop sideburns. 
DON (CONT'D) (V.0.) One day. Captain Mertin received an unexpected visitor. 
Lotte grabs the parrot off her head and leaves the room. 
PARROT (0.S.) Help! She's locking me in a cage! 
Lotte reenters. 
LOTTE Isn't that cute? I just taught her that. 
CRAIG Adorable. What time are they supposed to be here? 
LOTTE Seven-ish 
CRAIG We have to make it an early night. 
LOTTE They'll understand. Besides I've got a morning appointment tomorrow with Elijah's shrink. We're getting to the bottom of this acid stomach. 
CRAIG (not paying attention) Hmmm. 
LOTTE Some sort of childhood trauma, she thinks. Possible feelings of inadequacy as a chimp. Interesting, huh? 
CRAIG Hmmm. 
The doorbell rings. The dog barks. The parrot screams. The neighbor pounds on the wall. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. CRAIG AND LOTTE'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
The dining room table is set up. Craig and Lotte and their friends Peter and Gloria are seated and eating dinner. There is an obvious lull in the conversation. 
PETER Good food, Lotte. 
LOTTE Thanks. Craig helped, too, by the way. 
PETER Vegetarian, right? 
LOTTE Yes. All vegetable. all the time. 
PETER Amazing. 
There is another lull. Everyone eats. 
PETER (CONT'D) No kidding about that 7 1/2 floor. Craig? 
CRAIG No kidding, Peter. 
GLORIA That's great. It almost sounds like make-believe. (beat) Like a storybook. (beat) like a fairy tale. (beat) It's really great. (beat) So Lotte, when you say all vegetable, do you mean all vegetable entire1y? 
CUT TO: 
INT. PETER AND GLORIA'S CAR - NIGHT 
Gloria and Peter drive in silence. 
GLORIA Lotte told me that Eskimos have a lot of words for snow. 
PETER How many? 
GLORIA Ten, I think. 
PETER I wonder why so many. 
GLORIA Because they have a lot of snow. Isn't that interesting?

CUT TO: 
INT. LESTERCORP FILE ROOM - MORNING 
Craig in a cream colored suit, pours over the file cabinets. Floris watches from the doorway. 
FLORIS You're good. 
Craig turns. 
LESTER Don't toy with Floris, Schwartz. Why, if I were eighty years younger, I'd box your ears. 
CRAIG I wasn't toying with her, sir. I was just... How old are you? 
LESTER One hundred and five. Carrot juice. (beat) Lot's of it. I swear, it's almost not worth it. I piss orange. Oh, and I, have to piss sitting down... like a godamn girly... every fifteen minutes. But nobody wants to die, Schwartz. 
CRAIG I'll keep that in mind, sir. 
LESTER No sir-e-bob, I don't die. But what I do is get older, wrinkled like a former plum that's become the wrinkled prune you see before you. Oh, to be a young man again, maybe then Floris would care for me. 
CRAIG The elderly have so much to offer, sir. They are our link with history. 
LESTER I don't want to be your godamn link, damn you. I want to feel Floris' naked thighs against my own. I want to know passion. I want my body to inspire lust in that beautiful, complex woman. I want her to shiver in a spasm of ecstasy when I penetrate her. Oh, God, the agony of the flesh, Schwartz. 
CRAIG Dr. Lester, while I am flattered that you share your feelings with me, I believe perhaps the workplace is not the most suitable environment for this type of discussion. 
LESTER All right. Meet me at the Juicy-Juice Juice Bar after work today and I'll spill my goddamn guts for you. 
Lester exits. 
CRAIG Shit. 
CUT TO: 
INT. HALLWAY 7 1/2 FLOOR - DAY 
Craig squats next to a payphone. 
CRAIG (into phone) I won't be late. I just have to listen to Lester's sexual fantasies and drink carrot juice for a little while. It's a job thing. 
Maxine walks by. Craig grabs her arm, signals for her to wait a minute. She waits. 
CRAIG (CONT'D) (into phone) I gotta go back to work. Yeah, okay. You too. Okay. Bye. 
Craig hangs up. 
MAXINE What? 
CRAIG I just wanted to say hi.  Did you know I still don't know your name or where you work? 
MAXINE Yeah. 
CRAIG How about this, if I can guess your first name within three tries, you have to come out for a drink with me tonight. 
MAXINE Why not? 
CRAIG Great. (watches her face as he guesses) Buuuhhppaahhhhnnn. . . . . Muhhhahhhhh. . . . . ahhhnnnaaa. . nollltuuukkkaaaaralllll. . . tashabararassssssuuuuusaaaaaaa. . . nnnnnnnaaaaaannnnnnnnncccccceeeeeee Mwaaaaaa. . . . .Mahhhhhkkkkk. . . sssseeeeeen. Maxine? 
MAXINE Who told you? 
CRAIG I'm right? 
MAXINE Who told you? 
CRAIG That's incredible! Nobody told me! I swear! It's kismet. Maxine! It's a beautiful name. There's a psychic connection. Don't you see? It was meant to be! Maxine! Maxine! Maxine! I will shout it from the rooftops! 
MAXINE Somebody told you. 
CRAIG Oh, Maxine, nobody told me. Maxine, Maxine. It just came out of me like a song, Maxine. A beautiful crazy, song, Maxine. Maxine. Maxine! 
MAXINE I am dubious, but I don't welsh. Meet me at The Stuck Pig. Seven o'clock. You're late, I walk. So help me, if I find out you cheated. 
CRAIG (in heaven) Maxine. 
Craig walks down the hall. A tiny smile flits across Maxine's face. 
CUT TO: 
INT. JUICY JUICE BAR - EVENING 
Lester and Craig sit at a table. There are several emptied glasses of carrot juice in front of Lester. Craig nurses one glass, and keeps checking his watch. 
LESTER Imagine a room full of women. Nubile, blonde, wet with desire, Schwartz. A harem, if you will. Me in leather. A harness, if you like. I am the object of this desire, and all eyes are on me as I speak. Ladies, I begin. I am the love god, Eros. I intoxicate you. My spunk is to you manna from heaven... 
CRAIG (standing) Dr. Lester, it's been really fascinating, but I'm afraid I have to get home to my wife now. 
LESTER Wife, huh? I'd love to meet her, Craig. 
CRAIG Yessir. 
CRAIG Hi. 
LOTTE Hi. 
CRAIG (nervous, talking too much) Sorry, I'm so late. Lester just wouldn't let me go. Were supposed to have dinner with him on Friday. I can get us out of it if you want. He's really amazing, this insane old lech. It's actually sort of amusing when you get past just how disgusting it is. 
There is a silence. Lotte continues to comb out Elijah. Finally: 
LOTTE Did you eat? 
CRAIG Nah. I'm not hungry. I'm sorry I didn't call. It was just, you know, hard to get away. 
LOTTE I was worried. 
CRAIG I'm sorry. How was your evening? 
LOTTE Tom-Tom's puncture wound is infected. 
CRAIG The ferret? 
LOTTE The iguana. 
CRAIG Right. 
LOTTE I dressed the wound. Then I've just been feeding everyone, putting everyone to bed. 
CRAIG Yeah. You want a beer? 
LOTTE No thanks. I'm going to turn in. 
CRAIG All right. I'll be in my workshop for a little while. I'll be in in a little while. I need to unwind a little. (beat) I'll be in soon. A little while. 
LOTTE 'kay. 
Lotte exits. 
CUT TO: 
INT. GARAGE - NIGHT 
Craig works the Craig and Maxine puppets. The puppets sit on the edge of the small stage and chat. Craig does a pretty fair impersonation of Maxine's voice. 
CRAIG (as Maxine, fascinated) Tell me, Craig, why do you love puppeteering? (as Craig) Well, Maxine, I'm not sure exactly. Perhaps it's the idea of becoming someone else for a little while. Being inside another skin. Moving differently, thinking differently, feeling differently. (as Maxine) Interesting. Would you like to be inside my skin, Craig? Think what I think? Feel what I feel? (as Craig) More than anything. Maxine. (as Maxine) It's good in here, Craig. Better than your wildest dreams. 
The puppets kiss. 
CUT TO: 
INT. HALLWAY 7 1/2 FLOOR - DAY 
Craig waits at the coffee machine. Checks his watch. Finally Maxine approaches. 
CRAIG Hi. 
MAXINE You're not someone I could get interested in. Craig. You play with dolls. 
CRAIG (rehearsed) Puppets. Maxine. It's the idea of being inside someone else, feeling what they feel, seeing what they see... 
MAXINE Yikes. 
CRAIG Please, let me explain. 
Craig grabs Maxine's hand and drags her into an empty office. 
CUT TO: 
INT. EMPTY OFFICE - DAY 
Craig pulls Maxine in closes the door. 
CRAIG It's just, and I've never done this before, Maxine, but it's just that I feel something for you. I've never felt this before for anyone, not even my wife. My future is with you, Maxine. 
MAXINE You might want to check those tarot cards one more time. 
Maxine heads for the door. Craig sits on a box. He puts his head in his hands and sighs. Across the room he notices a very small door with a two by four nailed across it. 
CRAIG Another evil secret of the 7 1/2 floor. 
Craig pries the two-by-four off and opens the door. It's a dark and wet membranous tunnel inside. 
Craig opens the little door and climbs into the membranous hallway. The door slams shut behind him. 
CUT TO: 
INT. HALLWAY - MORNING 
It's dark and wet. The walls are soft and membranous. There is a dripping sound. Craig crawls along. Soon something starts to pull Craig as if he is being sucked through a straw. There is a flash of light. 
CUT TO: 
INT. FANCY DINING ROOM - MORNING 
The POV of someone reading a newspaper. The person lifts a cup of coffee to his mouth. There is a slurping sound. The person puts down the coffee cup and the newspaper, and stands up. 
CRAIG (CONT'D) (V.0.) (losing his balance) Whoa! What the hell? Where am I? 
We're still in POV. The person walks across the room, picks up his wallet from a coffee table. looks in a mirror and checks his teeth for food. It's John Malkovich. 
CRAIG (CONT'D) (V.0.) Holy shit! It's that actor guy. Shit! What's his name? That actor guy! What's happening? Am I inside him? Am I in his brain? Am I him? Is he me? Does he know I'm here? My brain is reeling! Is his brain reeling? 
Malkovich walks to the front door, opens it, exits his apartment. 
CUT TO: 
INT. MAXINE'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS 
Maxine sits at her desk, eats a sandwich. looks at a fashion magazine, and chats on the phone. 
MAXINE The puppeteer told me he loves me today. (laughs) I know. I can't think of anything more pathetic.

The cabbie studies Malkovich in his rearview mirror as he drives. 
CABBIE Say, aren't you that actor guy? 
MALKOVICH Yeah. 
CABBIE John Makel... 
CRAIG (V.0.) John Malkovich! Of course! 
CABBIE Mapplethorpe? 
MALKOVICH (V.0.) Malkovich. 
CABBIE Malkovich! 
CRAIG (V.0.) John fucking Malkovich! 
CABBIE Yeah. I liked you in that one movie. 
MALKOVICH (V.0.) Thank you. 
CABBIE The one where you're that jewel thief. 
MALKOVICH I never played a jewel thief. 
CABBIE Who am I thinking of? 
MALKOVICH I don't know. 
CABBIE I'm pretty sure it was you. Hey, could I get your autograph now? It's for .... oh, what the hell, it's for me! I'm your biggest fan! 
MALKOVICH Yeah, okay. 
The cabbie hands a pad back over the seat. Malkovich reaches for it. There is a slurping sound. 
CRAIG (V.0.) (panicky) Ahhhh! 
The image starts to fade, then suddenly goes black. 
CUT TO: 
CRAIG (nervously) Well, you know we're going to be very busy tomorrow. I'll tell you what. Let's do it tonight. Right now. 
LOTTE Now? 
CRAIG Yeah. We'll do it right now. On the way to Lester's house.

Craig hurries out the door. 
CUT TO: 
INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT 
Malkovich is in the shower. We watch from his POV as he soaps himself. He does this in a sensual manner.

CRAIG We'll talk about it in the car. 
Craig helps Lotte up and toward the car. 
CUT TO: 
INT. CRAIG AND LOTTE'S CAR - NIGHT 
Craig drives. Lotte looks distractedly out the window. 
LOTTE I have to go back, Craig. Being inside did something to me. All of a sudden everything made sense. I knew who I was. 
CRAIG You weren't you. You were John Malkovich. 
LOTTE (tickled) I was, wasn't I? (yelling out the window) I was John fucking Malkovich! (laughs, then intensely) Take me back, Craig. 
CRAIG Tomorrow. We're late for Lester. 
CUT TO: 
INT. LESTER'S DINING ROOM - NIGHT 
It's a posh place with flocked wallpaper and candelabras. Lester, Craig, and Lotte sit around an elegantly appointed table with all different sorts of juices in front of them. Lotte is still wet. Lester sits quite close to her. 
LESTER Tell me, Lotte, can you understand a word I'm saying? 
LOTTE Yes, of course, Dr. Lester. 
LESTER Oh, be still my heart. 
LOTTE Dr. Lester, would you point me toward the restroom? 
LESTER With immense pleasure, my dear. Down that hall, ninth door on the left. Watch the step down. It's sunken, you know. 
CRAIG (cont'd) (beat) It's just the thrill of seeing through someone else's eyes, sweetie. It'll pass. 
LOTTE Don't stand in the way of my actualization as a man, Craig. 
MAXINE (hanging up the phone) Let her go, Craig. I mean him."

MALKOVICH (reading aloud) So you believe in God... you got something for it? You worked for all the capitalists. You harvested the fruit from your labor? You got God! 
LOTTE (V.0.) What raw, animal power! 
MALKOVICH But the past comforts you? The present smiles on you, yes? 
The phone rings. Malkovich puts down the script, and picks up the phone.

MAXINE (0.S.) You don't know me, but I'm a great admirer of yours. 
MALKOVICH How'd you get this number? 
MAXINE (0.S.) It's just that I fantasize about you and, well, speaking to you now has gotten me sort of excited and... 
LOTTE (0.S.) (turned on) Oh, I like this. 
MALKOVICH Listen, this is not amusing. Please don't call here any... 
MAXINE (0.S.) (giggling) Ooh, such authority! NY nipples are at attention, General Malkovich, sir. So I'll be at Bernardo's tonight at eight. Please, please meet me there. I just adored you in that jewel thief movie... 
Malkovich hangs up the phone. 
LOTTE (V.O.) My God! (attempting thought control) Meet her there. Meet her there. Meet her there. Meet her there. Meet her there... 
Malkovich goes back to his script. 
LOTTE (V.O.) (CONT'D) Meet her there. Meet her there. Meet her there...

CRAIG Yeah, well welcome to the nineties. 
LOTTE Suck my dick! 
CRAIG (slapping her) Shut up! 
Lotte is stunned. She feels the muzzle against her forehead. She shuts up. Keeping the gun trained on Lotte, Craig dials the phone. He hands the receiver to her. He holds his ear to the receiver also. 
CRAIG (CONT'D) Tell her you need to see her.

MAXINE (V.O.) J.M. Inc. Be all that someone else can be. 
LOTTE (looking at Craig) I have to see you. 
MAXINE (V.O.) Sweetie! Oh, but we can't. It's business hours. I need to keep the membranous tunnel open for paying customers. 
CRAIG (sotto) Tell her, what the hell, close early today, live dangerously. 
LOTTE What the hell, darling. Close early today, live dangerously. 
MAXINE (V.O.) Oooh, doll. I love this new devil-may-care side of you. Alrighty, I'll track down Lover-boy, and I'll see both of you in one hour. Exactamundo. 
Maxine hangs up. Lotte hands the phone to Craig, who hangs it up. Craig opens up the big cage where Elijah is housed, and motions with the gun for Lotte to enter. 
LOTTE (screaming) Help! He's locking me in a cage! 
Craig slaps Lotte hard. She looks at him, almost sadly. 
NEIGHBOR Shut up! 
PARROT Shut up! 
CRAIG Lesson number one:  Be careful what you teach your parrot. 
Craig tapes Lotte's mouth, ties her hands and feet. Elijah watches him tie her. He becomes somewhat agitated, and holds his stomach. 
CUT TO: 
The waiter jots it down on his pad. 
WAITER MALKOVICH Malkovich. 
Malkovich pushes himself away from the table and runs for the exit. He passes the stage where a girl singer Malkovich is singin sensuously into the microphone. She is backed by a '40's style big band of Malkoviches. 
SINGING MALKOVICH Malkovich Malkovich Malkovich Malkovich... 
Malkovich flies through the back door. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. DITCH - DAY 
Malkovich lands with a thud in the ditch. Craig is waiting there with his van. On its side is painted "See The World in Malk-O-Vision" followed by a phone number. Malkovich is huddled and shivering and soaking wet. 
CRAIG So how was it? 
MALKOVICH That... was... no... simulation. 
CRAIG I know. I'm sorry... 
MALKOVICH I have been to the dark side. I have seen a world that no man should ever see. 
CRAIG Really? For most people it's a rather pleasant experience. What exactly did you... 
MALKOVICH This portal is mine and must be sealed up forever. For the love of God. 
CRAIG With all respect, sir, I discovered that portal. Its my livelihood. 
MALKOVICH It's my head, Schwartz, and I'll see you in court! 
Malkovich trudges off along the shoulder of the turnpike. 
CRAIG (calling after him) And who's to say I won't be seeing what you're seeing... in court? 
Cars whiz by Malkovich. Someone yells from a passing car. 
MOTORIST Hey, Malkovich! Think fast! 
Malkovich looks up. A beer can comes flying out of the car and hits him on the head. 
CUT TO: 
INT. CRAIG AND LOTTE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
Craig is feeding the animals. His gun is stuck in his pants. He gets to Lotte's cage. She is bound but ungagged. She looks haggard. 
LOTTE Once this was a relationship based on love. Now you have me in a cage with a monkey and a gun to my head. 
CRAIG Things change. Anyway, you gave up your claim to that love the first time you stuck your dick in Maxine. 
LOTTE You fell in love with her first. 
CRAIG Yeah but I didn't do anything about it. Out of respect for our marriage. 
LOTTE You didn't do anything about it out of respect for the fact that she wouldn't let you near her with a ten foot pole, which is, by the way, about nine feet, nine inches off the mark anyway. 
CRAIG (beat) That's true. Oh, God, Lotte, what have I become? My wife in a cage with a monkey. A gun in my hand. Betrayal in my heart. 
LOTTE Maybe this is what you've always been, Craig, you just never faced it before. 
CRAIG Perhaps you're right. I can't let you go though. Too much has happened. You're my ace in the hole. 
LOTTE I need a shower. 
CRAIG I'm sorry. Oh God, I'm sorry. I'm some kind of monster. I'm the guy you read about in the paper and go, "he's some kind of monster." 
LOTTE You're not a monster, Craig. Just a confused man. 
CRAIG I love you so much. 
She dials her phone, opens her cage, puts phone to her ear. 
CRAIG (CONT'D) But I gotta go now. I've got to go be Johnny. 
MAXINE (O.S.) J.M. Inc. Be all that someone... 
LOTTE We have to meet. 
CUT TO: 
INT. LESTER'S OFFICE - NIGHT 
Lester's hand is in a bloody bandage. The juicer sits on hi desk. Lotte sits across from him looking nervous and hollow-eyed. 
LESTER You know I think it pays to leave juice-making to the trained professionals. You look terrible, my dear. 
LOTTE Craig stole Maxine from me, Dr. Lester. 
LESTER Hmmm, a lesbian, are you? I must inform you that I find that highly arousing. 
LOTTE No, you don't understand. I've been inside Malkovich when I'm with Maxine... 
LESTER (slaps Lotte furiously) What?! That is not allowed. My God, you are supposed to be one of us. You know you must never partake of Malkovich by yourself! 
LOTTE No, I didn't know that. 
LESTER Oh, didn't anyone show you the indoctrination video? 
LOTTE No. 
LESTER Oh, sorry. Right this way. 
CUT TO: 
INT. SCREENING ROOM - NIGHT 
Lotte site next to Lester in the darkened auditorium. The projector whirs. The screen lights up. 
TITLE: SO YOU WANT TO BE JOHN MALKOVICH 
A much younger Lester addresses the camera in this black and white film, which seems to have been made in the 50's. 
LESTER ON FILM Welcome, my fellow Malkovichians. As you may already know, today a baby was born into this sad world. 
We see a shot of a newborn. 
LESTER ON FILM (CONT'D) His name is John Horatio Hannibal Malkovich. And we are the keepers of the door to his soul. One day, when his brain is big enough, we will all journey into his head and live there for all eternity. Following the teachings of our leader Karl Marx, we will build the ultimate communist community, one body and hundreds, maybe thousands, of brains inside working together to form a super human intellect capable of curing disease, stopping all war, and ruling the world with a benevolent fist. We will take a wife, a woman of uncommon beauty and intellect, who is, as yet, still an infant herself. 
We see a photo of another infant, this one with a ribbon in her hair. 
LESTER ON FILM (CONT'D) Her name is Floris Horatia Hannibella DeMent. 
LOTTE Does Floris know that she's the chosen? 
LESTER Well, I tried to explain it to her, but... 
Lester points to his ear and shrugs. 
CUT TO: 
INT. MALKOVICH'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Malkovich and Maxine lie naked on the bed, looking quite relaxed. 
MAXINE You still there, sweets? 
MALKOVICH Yeah. I've figured out how to hold on as long as I want. Oddly enough, it's all in the wrists. 
MAXINE Wow. (little girl pout) Do a puppet show for me, Craig honey. 
MALKOVICH You mean with Malkovich? 
MAXINE I'd love to see your work. 
MALKOVICH (pleased) Really? Yeah. Okay. 
Malkovich leans over and kisses her, then gets up. 
MALKOVICH (CONT'D) I'll do something I call "Craig's Dance of Despair and Disillusionment." 
Malkovich performs the same dance that the Craig pupper did at the beginning of the film. It is exactly the same, complete with impossible somersaults and perspiring brow. He finishes by falling to his knees and weeping. 
MAXINE (moved) That was incredible. You're brilliant! 
MALKOVICH You see, Maxine, it isn't just playing with dolls. 
MAXINE You're right, my darling, it's so much more. It's playing with people! 
AGENT (CONT'D) John! Great to see you! Sorry about the cunt at reception. 
MALKOVICH This is my fiancee Maxine. 
The agent shakes Maxine's hand. 
AGENT Great to see you, Maxine. Sorry about the cunt at reception. Please have a seat. 
Malkovich and Maxine sit. 
AGENT (CONT'D) Can I get you anything? Coffee? Water? 
MAXINE No thanks. 
AGENT (into phone) Teresa, get me a chicken soup. (to Malkovich and Maxine) Chicken soup? 
Maxine and Malkovich shake their heads "no." 
MALKOVICH I'll get right to the point, Larry. I'm a puppet now... 
AGENT Okay. 
MALKOVICH I'm being controlled by the world's greatest puppeteer, Craig Schwartz... 
AGENT (no clue) Oh yeah, he's good. 
MALKOVICH ... and I want to show off his skills by performing a one-puppet extravaganza in Reno. 
MAXINE Vegas. 
MALKOVICH Vegas. Can you arrange that? 
AGENT Sure, sure. Just let me make a couple of calls. 
CUT TO: 
INT. CRAIG AND MAXINE'S OFFICE - DAY 
The cult members are still there, now with picks shovels. They are worn out and sweaty. The portal is excavated, but it seems ragged and destroyed. Man #2 emerges from the hole, a rope tied around his waist. 
MAN #2 That's the last of it, boss. 
Lester peers through the door. 
LESTER Well, let's see what we've got here. 
Lester crawls into the tunnel, the door slams behind him. 
CUT TO: 
INT. PORTAL - CONTINUOUS 
Lester crawls through. There is a slurping sound and a flash of light. 
CUT TO: 
INT. BUNKER - DAY 
The scene is in black and white. Bombs are dropping. There is a blonde in forties clothes there. Lester views the scene through somebody's POV. 
LESTER (V.O.) My God, where am I? This seems so familiar. 
The person walks past a mirror. It's Hitler. 
LESTER (V.O.) My God, I'm Hitler in the bunker! Aaaahhhh! Aaaah! 
DIRECTOR Cut! 
We look over to see a director and camera crew. 
LESTER (V.O.) Oh, I'm just the actor in that Twilight Zone episode. 
There is a popping sound. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. DITCH - DAY 
Lester pops into the ditch. One of his cult members is waiting with a car, and looking hopeful. Lester sadly shakes his head "no." 
LESTER But of course. 
WOMAN #1 Count me in. 
LESTER Good. I think its time to beckon Mr. Flemmer. Perhaps He can help us out of this pickle. 
FLIP TO: 
INT. LESTER'S SHRINE ROOM - A BIT LATER 
Mr. Flemmer, a silver-haired gentleman in turtleneck and blazer, scratches his head. The cultists patiently watch him. 
FLEMMER Boy, this is a toughie. To be honest, I didn't anticipate this. 
LESTER And as I said, sir, we can't very well exert physical persuasion upon the sacred vessel Malkovich. 
FLEMMER Right, Lester. I heard you the first time. I'm not a dummy. 
LESTER Didn't mean to imply that you were, sir. 
FLEMMER Look, I'm going back to my house to ponder this. So stay calm and keep track of Schwartz's comings and goings. Oh, and somebody dispose of Schwartz's wife, will you? (to cultists) Nice to meet you all. 
The cult members ad-lib "same here, sir." 
CUT TO: 
INT. CRAIG AND LOTTE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
Lotte site in the living room, in her pajamas, softly sobbing. The caged animals watch her. 
LOTTE Oh, my friends. Be thankful you're not human. People are treacherous and greedy and corrupt. I've lost my heart to two of them and I almost lost my soul to another. And I'm no better. Look at the way I keep you, locked in cages, for my own enjoyment. Well, I've been in a cage too, my friends. Literally and figuratively. So tonight I set you free. 
Lotte opens the windows and the front door, then unlocks all the cages. The animals scurry and fly out of their cages, and out of the house. Lotte watches silently until she is alone. 
LOTTE (CONT'D) Good-bye, friends. 
A hand reaches for hers. She looks down. Elijah is still there and holding her hand. She smiles. 
LOTTE (CONT'D) Hello, friend 
CUT TO: 
EXT. CITY STREET - NIGHT 
We see the menagerie of animals on the otherwise deserted street, dispersing into the night. A lone dark figure turns the corner, and walks slowly up the street to Craig and Lotte's building. 
CUT TO: 
INT. CRAIG AND LOTTE'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS 
Lotte and Elijah see the dark figure coming up the steps. The buzzer rings. Lotte and Elijah jump. 
LOTTE They've come to kill me, Elijah. See, I know too much. I should get the door. It's impolite to keep death waiting. 
Elijah looks at her sweetly, a great sadness in his eyes. Then he leads her by the hand out the window. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. VEGAS HOTEL - NIGHT 
The marquee reads:  World's Greatest Puppeteer Craig Schwartz and his Magical Puppet John Malkovich. 
CUT TO: 
INT. DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT 
Malkovich sits in a tuxedo and watches himself in the dressing table mirror. Maxine, in a tight black number, reclines on the couch. 
MAXINE This is it, lover. You're stepping onto that stage a nobody and presto-change-o, you're coming back the greatest puppeteer the world has ever seen. 
MALKOVICH I'm nervous. Malkovich is fighting me hard today. 
Malkovich jerks a bit, gets it under control. 
MAXINE Doesn't he know how important tonight is to us? 
MALKOVICH He's a selfish bastard. 
CUT TO: 
MALKOVICH They love me, darling! "Craig Schwartz is fantastic!"  The New York Times. "If only Craig Schwartz had always been inside Malkovich!"  Women's Wear Daily. "Craig Schwartz - The world's greatest puppeteer!"  Paul Wunder, WBAI Radio. 
MAXINE Oh, darling. It's a dream come true. We're going to ride this straight to the top. 
MALKOVICH Sleepy suddenly. 
MAXINE Busy day, my little fire chief. Why don't you climb into bed, and I'll meet you there in just... 
But Malkovich is already passed out on the floor on top of his clippings. Maxine smiles maternally, gets up and puts blanket over him. We stay on Malkovich's face. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. HELL - NIGHT 
Craig wanders across a jagged, rocky landscape. Geysers of flame shoot up around him. The sky is red. He is frightened. He arrives at a desk. The man behind the desk is facing away from him. He swivels to face Craig. It is Flemmer, looking the same as usual except for little red horns and a sinister grin. 
CRAIG Who are you? 
FLEMMER I am the Devil. 
CRAIG Oh. 
FLEMMER Leave Malkovich. He is mine. 
CRAIG Okay. Sorry. I didn't know. 
CUT TO: 
INT. HOTEL SUITE - CONTINUOUS 
Malkovich awakes with a start. Maxine looks over at him. 
MAXINE Bad dream, darling? 
MALKOVICH I've got to leave Malkovich. 
MAXINE You've got to be kidding. 
MALKOVICH I just had the most horrifying nightmare. The devil was in it. 
Flemmer crouches behind a bureau and listens. He is pleased with himself. 
MAXINE Malkovich is our meal ticket. You can't back out because of some stupid dream. 
FLEMMER (to himself) Shit. 
MALKOVICH Honey, we can be happy and poor together. 
MAXINE (laughs derisively) Perhaps you'll want to consult that Ouija board again. 
There is a knock at the door. Maxine opens it, angry. 
MAXINE (CONT'D) Yeah what?! 
MALKOVICH Derek Mantini! 
Mantini enters. Maxine is suddenly interested. Mantini and Maxine give each other the once over. 
MANTINI (still eyeing Maxine) Hello, Schwartz. I saw your show. 
MALKOVICH Did you see the reviews? 
MANTINI Yeah, I saw them 
MALKOVICH Because if you missed any, I just happen to have copies here you can take with you when you leave now. 
MAXINE I'm Maxine. I produced the evening with Malkovich. 
MANTINI Very impressive. I could use a producer with your vision. And other outstanding attributes. 
MALKOVICH She's not available. 
MANTINI We'll see, Schwartz. We'll see. 
MAXINE Yeah, we'll see, Schwartz. We'll see. 
MANTINI I won't waste your time Schwartz, or more importantly, mine. Here's my proposal: There's only room in this world for one "World's Greatest Puppeteer."  Correct? So let's allow the puppet-going public to crown their king. 
MALKOVICH How do we do that? 
Lotte turns away, shaken. A tear rolls down her face. 
LOTTE What have I become? 
CUT TO: 
EXT. BROADHURST THEATER - NIGHT 
The Marquee reads: Derek Mantini's sixty-foot Harry S. Truman puppet and Craig Schwartz's actual-size John Malkovich puppet in Peter Shaffer's "Equus." 
CUT TO: 
INT. BROADHURST THEATER - NIGHT 
The house is packed. On stage is a minimalist set: wood planks and metal poles. Six guys in brown turtlenecks and stylized wire horse heads mill about. The 60 foot Harry S. Truman puppet is pacing, his strings extending up into the flyspace and out of sight. Malkovich sits on a bench. Truman and Malkovich both take stabs at British accents. 
HARRY S. TRUMAN PUPPET Do you dream often? 
MALKOVICH Do you? 
HARRY S. TRUMAN PUPPET It's my job to ask the questions. Yours to answer them. 
MALKOVICH Says who? 
HARRY S. TRUMAN PUPPET Says me. Do you dream often? 
MALKOVICH Do you? 
We see the audience fidgeting in their seats, coughing. 
CUT TO: 
INT. BROADHURST BACKSTAGE - CONTINUOUS 
The dialogue drones on as Maxine watches coolly from the wings. She drags on a cigarette. Mr. Flemmer, dressed as a stagehand, stands behind Maxine. He also watches the actors, with an occasional sideways glance at Maxine. 
MAXINE (without turning around) Keep your eyes in your pants, old timer. 
CUT TO: 
INT. THE BROADHURST LOBBY - A BIT LATER 
It's intermission. The lobby is crowded. Maxine moves through the crowd listening to snippets of conversation. Flemmer, now in a tuxedo, moves about also. First couple: 
THEATERGOER #1 That Truman puppet is downright boring as the psychiatrist. 
THEATERGOER #2 It's a wooden performance, really. Get it? Wooden? 
Second couple: 
THEATERGOER #3 What's with the Malkovich puppet? He was much better in Vegas when he played the piano with his feet. 
THEATERGOER #4 I hate it when they try to stretch. It's like Woody Allen. 
Third couple: 
THEATERGOER #5 They both stink! I'm going across the street to second act Miss Saigon. 
CUT TO: 
INT. DRESSING ROOM - A FEW MINUTES LATER 
Malkovich watches himself in his dressing table mirror. Maxine enters, flops herself down on the couch and lights up a cigarette. 
MAXINE You'd better turn on the pyrotechnics, lover, 'cause right now you're running neck and neck with the dead president. And you're both in last place. 
Malkovich continues to watch himself in the mirror, nods his head. 
CUT TO: 
INT. CATWALK ABOVE STAGE - CONTINUOUS 
Mantini leans against a rail and smokes a cigarette. Charles Nelson Reilly, in a tuxedo, confers with him in hushed tones. 
CHARLES NELSON REILLY You're doing beautifully, my boy. I wept at the speech about your wife. 
Flemmer materializes behind Mantini 
CHARLES NELSON REILLY What the hell? Nyong-nyong! 
INT. CRAIG AND MAXINE'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS 
Lester is surrounded by all the Malkovichians. He holds the walkie-talkie, has just received word. He nods, and the Malkovichians crawl in single file into the portal, while shrieking a war cry. 
CUT TO: 
INT. BACKSTAGE - CONTINUOUS 
Maxine watches as Malkovich pulls himself up off the ground. Suddenly, he is again possessed, first by one person, then by two, then by three, his body jerking and pulsating with each new occupant. It's almost like popping corn, starting out slowly, then going faster and faster, until Malkovich is possessed by all fifty Malkovichians. He shrieks a war cry and runs out onto the stage. 
CUT TO: 
INT. STAGE - CONTINUOUS 
The Truman puppet now hangs limply from the catwalks. Malkovich hovers just above the stage and addresses the audience. 
MALKOVICH (now sounding like fifty voices) I am your earthly king! Kneel before me! 
The audience scoffs at first, but then are compelled to their knees. 
CROWD (like automatons) Hail Malkovich, king of the damned. 
Malkovich laughs, gives the thumbs up sign to Flemmer in the catwalks. Flemmer gives the thumbs up sign back. 
Lotte appears in the back of the theater, an out-of-breath figure in shadows. It is too late. She runs from the theater. 
CUT TO: 
INT. BACKSTAGE - CONTINUOUS 
Maxine watches, somewhat amused. She turns and heads for the exit. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. NEW JERSEY TUNPIKE - NIGHT 
A dejected Craig walks along the shoulder. He is wet and cold. We hold on him for a long while until he eventually merges with the landscape. 
FADE OUT 
FADE IN 
EXT. MANHATTAN STREET - DAY 
CHYRON:  LATER THAT WEEK 
Something is wrong. It's a typical midtown street, but everything is painted gray:  the buildings, the streets, the sidewalks, the cars. People walk along the streets, carrying gray briefcases, wearing gray jumpsuits. Nobody talks, nobody smiles. Gray birds fly silently in the sky. There is no noise whatsoever. There are several movie theaters on the block. All marquees advertise John Malkovich movies. Around the corner comes Malkovich. He is floating about ten feet off the ground on an enormous, bright red, jeweled throne. He wears a gold crown and purple silk robe and smiles condescendingly, majestically. Floris sits on his lap. She is dressed in an orange satin gown. Nobody on the street looks up. 
MALKOVICH (fifty voices) Greetings, my lowly subjects. 
FLORIS Great things, my lonely subtext? 
MALKOVICH (rolls his eyes) Boy, be careful what you wish for. (to Floris) Never mind, dear. Just enjoy the ride, will you? 
Floris shrugs, picks at her finger nails. 
MALKOVICH (CONT'D) (to the people on the street) I am bored. You will dance for your king now. 
Without pause the entire street of gray clad people breaks into a meticulously choreographed production number. Totally silent, totally joyless, but exquisitely executed. We see that Maxine is one of the anonymous dancers. Her face is void of expression. Malkovich laughs. 
MALKOVICH (CONT'D) Faster! Faster, my little trained monkeys! 
The crowd dances faster and faster. Older people fall over, exhausted, clutching their hearts. Nobody stops dancing to help, nobody dares. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. CENTRAL PARK - DAY 
Bird's eye view of the park. It's all painted gray. Every tree, every leaf. There's no sign of life. The camera moves in, through some gray trees and gray brush to: 
A LUSH GREEN OASIS CAMOUFLAGED ON THE TOP AND SIDES WITH GRAY PAINT 
This place is filled with life:  Colorful birds, lizards, cats, a rooster. All the animals are active, happy, but totally silent, as if they know the precariousness of their position. Lotte and Elijah sit among them. These are the animals that she freed earlier. Lotte and Elijah hold hands and look into each other's eyes. We see that they both wear gold bands. They are husband and wife. Elijah signs. 
ELIJAH (SUBTITLES) Must you take this terrible demon on yourself, my love? 
LOTTE Yes. I'm the only one. I have to enter Malkovich and destroy him from the inside. If not me, who? 
ELIJAH (SUBTITLES) If there was any way I could go in your place. But I'm only a monkey and...
