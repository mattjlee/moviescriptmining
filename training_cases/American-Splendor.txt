"AMERICAN SPLENDOR" 
by 
Robert Pulcini and Shari Springer Berman 
PRODUCTION DRAFT 
FADE IN: 
INT. HARVEYS BEDROOM - NIGHT 
A BEDROOM MIRROR. 
The room is dark. A perfectly square mirror hangs crooked on a wall. 
Suddenly, out of the darkness, the reflection of a man's face comes into focus. He stares straight ahead, perhaps studying his own unrecognizable reflection. It's quite clear this is a portrait of sickness; the man's pallor is gray, his eyes are confused. There is something most definitely wrong. 
Tentatively, the figure steps away from the mirror, leaving the frame empty and dark. 
ANGLE ON BED 
Like a ghost, the naked man (Harvey) stands over his bed staring down at his sleeping wife (Joyce). In the eerie light, he's almost translucent. 
HARVEY (faintly) Joyce... Joyce? 
Joyce springs up, alarmed. 
JOYCE What's wrong, Harvey? What are you doing up? 
Harvey just stands there for a moment saying nothing. 
JOYCE What is it? 
HARVEY (delirious, out of breath) Tell me the truth. Am I some guy who writes about himself in a comic book? Or am I just -- am I just a character in that book? 
Joyce rubs her eyes. 
JOYCE Harvey... 
HARVEY If I die, will 'dat character keep goin'? Or will he just fade away... 
Joyce just stares at him, unsure how to answer. Suddenly Harvey collapses. 
Joyce leaps from the bed, nervous, hysterical. She gets down on the floor and shakes him. 
JOYCE Omigod, Harvey! Harvey, wake up! 
CLOSE ON HARVEY'S FACE 
His eyes remain closed, his expression far, far away. 
FADE TO BLACK: 
EXT. CLEVELAND ROW HOUSE - FALL - 1956 - DAY 
FADE UP ON: 
A surreal kaleidoscope of black, white and red. Similar to the mirror scene above, the colors slowly come into focus, revealing the chiseled features of a familiar face. But this time we see that it is not a real face, but rather a plastic mask of the D.C. Comic hero -- SUPERMAN. 
INTERTITLE: CLEVELAND OHIO, 1956 
CLOSE ON SUPERMAN MASK 
It glows eerily in the light of a porch lamp. A child's pupils glare through the eye holes... 
The camera pans from SUPERMAN to the masked face of another caped-crusader: BATMAN. Batman turns toward his loyal sidekick ROBIN, who clutches a plastic, trick-or-treat pumpkin. 
Next, we find THE GREEN LANTERN as he reaches up to ring the doorbell. The camera finally rests on the last boy: an unkempt KID wearing no costume at all. Looking irritated and removed from the rest of the group, the KID shoves his hands in the pockets of his shearling coat. 
He spits and rolls his eyes as a lady answers the door. 
--Buying used records from a garage sale table. 
INT. GREASY SPOON DINER - DAY 
--Eating junk food at a greasy spoon. 
INT. HARVEY'S APARTMENT - DAY 
Harvey fixes a rip in his coat with Elmer's Glue. 
(Note: Each "Cartoon Harvey" looks similar but unique... A variation on a theme. This is because his cartoons are drawn by different comic artists.) 
Intermittently, bold cartoon credits flash across the screen: 
FROM OFF THE STREETS OF CLEVELAND COMES... 
Followed by the explosive title: 
AMERICAN SPLENDOR 
The high-energy music and upbeat titles -- in direct contrast to the sulking image of Harvey -- continue through the remainder of the credits. 
EXT. CLEVELAND STREET OVERLOOKING FACTORIES - DAY 
We're now on HARVEY'S back as he continues his forlorn journey. We move forward, past him, to peer over the hill at the factories below. 
REAL HARVEY (V.O.) Okay. We're throwing a lot at ya here, so lemme step in an' help ya catch up. This is the story about comic books, an' a guy who made a whole life outta them. You could even say comics saved his life. This guy here, he's our man, Harvey Pekar -- all grown up and goin' nowhere. Although he's a pretty scholarly cat, he never got much of a formal education. For the most part, he's lived in shit neighborhoods, held shit jobs, and is now knee deep into a second disastrous marriage. So if yer lookin' for romance or escapism or some fantasy figure to save the day, guess what? Ya got the wrong movie. 
SUDDENLY EVERYTHING -- THE MUSIC, THE CREDITS, THE IMAGES -- COMES TO A HALT.

INT. SOUND STAGE - PRESENT - DAY 
HIGH DEFINITION VIDEO DOCUMENTARY FOOTAGE 
The REAL HARVEY PEKAR (not the actor who trudged through the credits) sits behind a microphone, supplying the "voice over" above. He clutches a movie script in his hand. 
The frame is spare, with a few well-chosen items to indicate that he's in a recording session. 
Although he is significantly older than the man who portrays him, the "Real Harvey" is every bit as much of a sad sack... maybe even more. He is large and slightly threatening with knitted brows and wild eyes. Yet there is something kind and vulnerable about him -- a teddy bear who could kick your ass. Off Camera, WE HEAR the voices of the male and female directors (us -- BOB and SHARI) coaching the "Real Harvey" through his voice over. Harvey's irritable and contrary, saying that the whole Halloween incident never even happened. 
"But I don't care man. I'm just doing this for the dough." We learn that Harvey is a reluctant participant in a film being made about his life. 
SUDDENLY, his third wife JOYCE BRABNER -- an intelligent control freak obsessed with all things negative -- joins in the conversation. Pushing back her huge glasses, she reprimands Harvey like he is an infant: "Harvey you are talking too loud, Harvey you are being difficult." Harvey just rolls his eyes. Joyce gets offended. It is clear they have had this argument a million times. As Joyce storms off... 
Harvey explains that his wife is trying to take over the movie. He laments that she is his third wife, and he has no luck with women. "Man, chicks just don't dig me." That's why he marries anyone who will have him. "And I marry them fast before they get to know the real me..."

INT. EXAMINATION ROOM - WINTER - 1975 - DAY 
INTERTITLE: 1975 
HARVEY sits on a table in his T-shirt and underwear. A DOCTOR unwraps a tongue depressor. 
Harvey's voice is hoarse, raspy and barely audible. It sounds like it hurts for him to talk. Yet, he can't stop ranting. 
HARVEY Doc, you gotta help me. My old lady's dumping me 'cause I can't talk. She says I'm a social embarrassment. Now that she's got her PhD, she's some hot shit academic star an' I'm nuthin' but a file clerk with nothin' ta say an' no voice ta say it. But me bein' a file clerk was fine when I wrote the damn check for her tuition -- 
DOCTOR #1 Harvey, stop talking please, and open wide. 
He points the tongue depressor at Harvey's mouth but he just keeps on going. 
HARVEY I just don't get it... We were doin' okay for a while. Then we took that stupid belated honeymoon. I started losin' my voice on the plane. Can you believe that... On the plane, doc? 
DOCTOR #1 Bad timing, I guess. Now please say "Ah," Mr. Pekar. 
HARVEY "Ahhh." (without missing a beat) "Ahhh" ruined the trip. I got crazy, started to worry my voice would never come back. I mean, my wife didn't know me so long before we got hitched. What if she totally forgets what I'm like? Man, it's torture -- 
Out of the corner of her eye, WOMAN #2 notices Harvey eavesdropping. 
WOMAN #2 (yelling at Harvey) Ay, what are you looking at? Maricone! 
Startled, Harvey moves on. 
EXT. ACROSS FROM A PARK - WINTER - 1975 - DAY 
He passes a group of KIDS playing in the snow. They scream, yell and laugh with abandon. 
HARVEY (shaking his head) They all make it seem so easy. 
Then, BAM! Harvey is awakened from his reverie by a snowball. The kids laugh loudly. He wipes away the snow and walks on. 
A VOICE OVER interrupts the scene. 
REAL HARVEY (V.O.) Here's our man walking home from the doctor's. He's got the weight of the world on him. And fer what, really? 'Cause his throat's a little screwy? Man, people in India are starvin' to death every day. His problems are nothin'. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. BRIDGE OVER TRAIN TRACKS - DAY 
Totally dejected, HARVEY crosses over train tracks on his way home. 
REAL HARVEY (V.O.) Still, he can't help feelin' paranoid, like some supernatural force is conspiring against him to rob him of his voice. 
EXT. HARVEY'S APARTMENT - WINTER - 1975 - DAY 
Harvey sulks up the steps of his brick low-rise apartment building. He passes an ELDERLY NEIGHBOR coming down the walk with her shopping cart. Harvey unlocks the door. 
REAL HARVEY (V.O.) Maybe his old lady will go easy on him today, when she sees how upset he is. 
INT. HARVEY'S LIVING ROOM - WINTER - 1975 - DAY 
Harvey's second wife LANA -- a hippyish chic with long hair and a bad attitude -- pulls books off a shelf and selectively throws them onto the floor or packs them into a milk crate. 
An overstuffed suitcase sits beside her. She's obviously leaving him. HARVEY enters the room. 
HARVEY (whispering) Ay... What is this? 
Harvey's voice breaks up. 
LANA Exactly what it looks like. 
HARVEY (loud) Whattya mean!! You mean yer dumpin' me?! Fer what? (his voice really rips) Ah, shit! 
That last yell did it. Harvey grabs throat in pain, torn between his throat discomfort and trying to stop his wife from leaving. 
LANA Look, your plebeian lifestyle isn't working for me anymore. Cleveland's not working for me anymore. I gotta get out of here before I kill myself. 
HARVEY But -- 
She gathers her bags and heads for the door. Harvey trails her, trying to reason. 
He opens his mouth, but nothing comes out. 
HARVEY (mouthing, just a wheeze) Please! Wait, honey... Just listen to what I got to say... 
She turns and stares at him. Harvey tries to say something. 
But now nothing at all comes out of his mouth. Only wheezes air. 
He tries again. No sound at all. 
Finally LANA gives up, turns back towards the door and leaves. 
SLAM!!

HIGH DEFINITION VIDEO DOCUMENTARY FOOTAGE 
Harvey sits on outdoor furniture. A few props are featured in the frame indicating a garage-sale-like setting (including a record player). Directly in front of Harvey are boxes of used records. 
HARVEY shows us his prodigious record collection. Thousands of LP's -- rare jazz, blues, fusion, klezmer, etc. -- are piled in floor-to-ceiling bookcases. 
He tells us about his love of jazz and how he started writing jazz reviews and music articles. He finds the first record that he reviewed and puts it on his turntable. As the music plays... 
Harvey talks about how he started buying and selling records. This leads into how he first met ROBERT CRUMB. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. CLEVELAND GARAGE SALE - FALL - 1962 - DAY 
INTERTITLE: 1962 
HARVEY (a little more hair but the exact same style) and a bunch of his BUDDIES sift through old records at a junk sale. 
REAL HARVEY (V.O.) In the early sixties I was with some buddies at a junk sale looking for some choice sides when I met this shy, retiring cat from Philadelphia named Bob Crumb. You know the guy; Fritz the Cat, Mr. Natural an' all -- they made a movie about him, too. 
One of Harvey's pals -- MARTY -- pulls a record out of a box. 
MARTY C'mon, Harv. You dig Jay McShann. You gonna buy that or what? 
Harvey jumps up from his search to check out the LP. 
HARVEY I don't know, Marty. It's got a lamination crack in it... (checking out the price) A quarter. Maybe I can get him down. 
MARTY You are one cheap bastard Harvey. 
HARVEY Yeah, I know I'm tight, man, but I live on a government wage. 
A skinny guy with a big nose, glasses and a ratty trench coat taps Harvey on the shoulder. He is soft-spoken, a bit shy and very odd -- a young ROBERT CRUMB. 
CRUMB You collect Jay McShann, man? 
HARVEY Yeah, man. How 'bout you? 
CRUMB Yeah but most of my records are back in Philly. 
A greaser-type guy in a leather jacket, PAHLS, joins them. 
PAHLS Harv, meet my buddy Bob Crumb. He just moved to town. He's an artist at American Greeting Card Company. 
HARVEY That's cool. 
PAHLS You should see his comics, Harv. They are outta sight. 
HARVEY (interested) Yeah? I'm into comics myself. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. HARVEY'S LIVING ROOM - FALL - 1962 - DAY 
A disheveled mess that gives new meaning to the term bachelor pad. Records and books are strewn everywhere. 
REAL HARVEY (V.O.) So Crumb showed me this comic book novel he was working on -- THE BIG YUM YUM BOOK. I'd never seen anything like it. 
HARVEY marches back and forth holding Crumb's illustrated comic novel. CRUMB sits on the floor nursing a beer and sorting through vintage comic books. Harvey's bursting with so much enthusiasm, it's almost aggressive. 
HARVEY It's terrific, man! I really dig your work. 
Crumb ignores Harvey's praise. 
CRUMB (holding up a vintage comic) This PETER WHEAT book is by Walt Kelly... It's pretty rare. 
HARVEY Yeah? Can I get good bread for it? 
HARVEY An' then on top of it I lost my voice for three months. I still sound like shit, but before I had nothin'. Man, talk about hell. I started forgettin' what I sound like, y'know? So I started writin' stuff down -- stories an' things, my points a' view, ideas. I even published a couple jazz record reviews. I guess that ended up bein' a good thing. 
CRUMB Uh-huh. 
HARVEY But don't think I buy into this "growth" crap. Everybody talks about how bad experiences can cause ya t'grow, an' all that clichéd stuff. I've had enough bad experiences and growth to last me plenty. (a beat) Right now, I'd be glad to trade some growth for happiness. 
For a moment, they both just sit there saying nothing to each other, each man in his own private universe. 
Finally Harvey looks over to Crumb. 
HARVEY So how long are ya stayin' in Cleveland? 
Crumb never looks up from his picture. 
CRUMB I dunno, man. I gotta go visit this chick in New York. And I'm really busy with the comic book stuff. It's good bread and all man but I'm getting fed up with the whole scene. 
HARVEY What are ya talkin' about? Yer makin' a good living doin' yer art? Sheesh. How many guys get that lucky in their life, huh? 
CRUMB Yeah, I dunno. 
HARVEY Ya know man, people are startin' to know the name "Crumb." When you croak you're gonna leave something behind. 
CRUMB Yeah, my ashes and some crappy doodles. It's not like I'm Blind Lemon Jefferson or Big Mama Thornton. 
HARVEY C'mon, man. It sure beats workin' a gig like mine -- being a nobody flunky and sellin' records on the side for a buck. 
CRUMB Yeah, well that's true... 
Harvey nods in agreement, mulling this over. He's not at all offended. 
CUT TO: 
INT. V.A. HOSPITAL - 1975 - DAY 
CLOSE ON A FILE DRAWER MARKED: "RECENTLY DECEASED." 
A hand reaches into the frame and opens the drawer. 
By rote, HARVEY fumbles with a large stack of "expired patient" files. He places each into the appropriate alphabetical "deceased" drawer. 
Attempting to grab another batch, Harvey accidentally knocks the entire pile onto the floor. 
HARVEY Damn it! 
He crouches down to survey the mess -- a collage of "expired lives" laid out before his eyes. 
We move past dozens of anonymous names -- William Anderson, Louis Collins, Mark D'Amico, Tyrone Moore, Franklin Ray, etc... Each file has a red "Deceased" stamp. 
Depressed, HARVEY is transfixed by the files surrounding him on the floor. Suddenly he stops and picks one up. 
ANGLE ON FOLDER: It is marked, "CHARLIE MARSHALL." 
He opens the folder and reads the stats... 
Born: 1920 in Cleveland Died: 1920 in Cleveland Occupation: Clerk 
ANGLE ON HARVEY: He swallows hard as he reads about Charlie's small, invisible and now vanished life... He tosses the folder back onto the pile. 
CUT TO: 
INT. HARVEY'S APARTMENT - 1975 - MORNING 
CLOSE ON: TWO STICK FIGURES IN AN EMPTY FRAME 
HARVEY sits at a table with a pen in hand and a blank sheet of paper in front of him. Nothing seems to come to him. 
He flips through a pile of comic books -- everything from D.C. Comic Super Heroes to underground works such as Crumb's Mr. Natural and Zap Comix. No inspiration. Harvey throws them down in frustration. 
HARVEY I'm starvin'. 
CUT TO: 
It is yet another grey day in Cleveland. The neighborhood is run-down. Garbage is strewn everywhere. 
The following scene unfolds through the window: 
Two UNSIGHTLY WORKERS lug an old, smelly mattress from a garage towards the garbage cans on the curb. Their conversation is distant, but entirely audible. 
MATTRESS GUY #1 So how smart is she? 
MATTRESS GUY #2 I dunno. I guess she's about average. 
MATTRESS GUY #1 Average? Hey, man. Average is dumb! 
They drop the mattress in place. With the window framing these guys, the scene FREEZES, looking just like a comic book panel. 
INT. HARVEY'S APARTMENT - DAY 
Harvey turns around from the scene and ponders it. He moves back towards his pile of stick-figure drawings. 
CLOSE ON PAPER 
Harvey scribbles the words "AMERICAN SPLENDOR" at the top of the page. 
CUT TO: 
INT. CLEVELAND DINER - 1975 - DAY 
The following scene is shot through the restaurant window. We see reflections of people walking by. 
A tense HARVEY starts at CRUMB as he eats a burger and reads Harvey's mock-ups. Harvey doesn't touch his burger deluxe and nervously talks in his laryngitis-afflicted voice. 
HARVEY See, ever since I read your stuff, man I've been thinking I could write comic book stories that were different from anything being done. 
CRUMB (munching on a fry) Uh-huh. 
HARVEY I'm thinkin', the guys who do animal comics and super-hero stuff are really limited 'cause they gotta try to appeal to kids. And underground comics like yours have been really subversive or opened things up politically. But there is still plenty more ta be done with 'em, too, y'know? 
CRUMB Pass me the ketchup? 
HARVEY I mean with pictures and words, it could be more of an art form. Like those French movies are. Or De Sica over in Italy, y'know?... So I tried writin' some things about real life. Stuff the everyman's gotta deal with. 
Crumb finally looks up from Harvey's work. 
CRUMB These are about you. 
HARVEY Er, yeah... 
CRUMB You turned yourself into a comic hero? 
HARVEY Sorta, yeah. But no idealized shit. No phony bullshit. The real thing, y'know? Ordinary life is pretty complex stuff. 
Crumb reads more. Harvey waits anxiously. Finally Crumb starts to chuckle. 
CRUMB These are really good, Harv. 
HARVEY (insecure) Really? Ya think so? 
Crumb shuffles through more. 
CRUMB Yeah. This is great stuff, man. I dig it. Can I take them home and illustrate them? 
Harvey is practically bursting. 
HARVEY Wow!! 
Harvey's voice breaks like a kid in puberty. He clears his throat. And something miraculous happens... 
When Harvey opens his mouth to speak his LARYNGITIS IS GONE! 
HARVEY You'd do that for me, man? That'd be great! I can't draw a straight line! 
CRUMB Hey, what's up with your voice, Harv? All of a sudden it sounds fine. 
Naked and disheveled, HARVEY tosses and turns in bed. 
REAL HARVEY (V.O.) My loneliness was unbearable, man. Weekends were the worst. Sometimes in my sleep, I'd feel a body next to me like an amputee feels a phantom limb. 
EXT. PEDESTRIAN BRIDGE -- DAY 
Extreme wide shot: a city-street overpass spans across the entire frame. The lone figure of Harvey sulks there in the middle, watching traffic pass below. 
REAL HARVEY (V.O.) Sure my comics were bringin' me notoriety, but my personal life was in shambles. I thought a little attention would make me feel better. It only made me feel worse. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. BAKERY SIDE STREET - SPRING - 1980'S - MORNING 
It is a beautiful, sunny day. The trees are in bloom. 
There's the first scent of spring in the air. Kids play in the street. Music pours out of passing cars. Everyone seems to have a smile on his or her face except HARVEY. He walks on the shadowy side of the street. 
EXT. BAKERY STREET - SPRING 
Establishing shot of HARVEY trudging into the bakery. 
INT. BAKERY - SPRING - 1980'S - MORNING 
A couple of WOMEN order bread and cookies from TWO COUNTER GIRLS. 
HARVEY surveys the donuts. 
COUNTER GIRL #1 (yelling to Harvey) Next! 
HARVEY (to the Counter Girl) Yeah! I'll have two crullers, a jelly donut with powdered sugar... And you got any "day old bread"? 
A woman with attractive Irish looks brushes past Harvey on her way to the door. This is ALICE QUINN, roughly Harvey's age but there is a tired, weary look in her eyes. 
ALICE Hey, you're Harvey Pekar. 
Half in a daze, Harvey stares at the chick. 
HARVEY Yeah... 
ALICE Alice Quinn. From school. 
Harvey studies her face. Suddenly, it clicks. 
HARVEY Oh yeah. College. We had a couple lit classes together. 
Harvey pays and receives his items. They step back towards the door. 
ALICE What happened to you? You just disappeared after one semester. 
Harvey scratches his armpit. 
HARVEY I know, man. I got good grades and all but there was this required math class. I can't do math, an' that required class hangin' over my head made me crazy. Eventually the pressure got to be too much. 
ALICE Well, you're doing okay anyway. I heard all about your jazz reviews and your comics. 
This perks Harvey up. 
HARVEY Ya did? 
ALICE Sure, you're famous. Meanwhile I got my degree but I'm just a plain old wife and mother. 
Harvey stares at her wedding ring. His face drops. 
HARVEY Yeah. I'm not doing as great as ya think. My second wife divorced me and I work at a dead end job as a file clerk. Sometimes I hang out with the guys on the corner but most of the time I just stay home by myself and read. 
Alice laughs. 
ALICE You're luckier than you think. My husband and kids make it impossible for me to cuddle up with a good book. 
CUT TO: 
JOYCE BRABNER, a depressive nudge with a perpetually peptic expression frantically searches the store for something. Her partner, a granola type named RAND, finishes unloading a stack on the shelf. 
JOYCE What happened to the new American Splendor? 
RAND We sold 'em, babe. 
JOYCE All of them? 
RAND Yep. 
JOYCE (accusatory) Damn it! I put one aside for myself, next to the register. I didn't even get a chance to read it. 
RAND Whoa, sorry, Joyce. I didn't know you were such a Splendor fan. Next time take it home. 
Joyce leans against the counter. She pushes up her glasses and looks really upset. 
JOYCE Maybe I'll call the publisher. But they take so damn long. Shit! Why does everything in my life have to be such a complicated disaster... 
Joyce starts slamming things around the store. Finally Rand grabs his stuff. 
RAND Okay, I'm gonna hustle before the vibe in here gets any worse. 
Rand leaves. Joyce barely notices, still brewing. 
CUT TO: 
INT. JOYCE'S BEDROOM - 1980'S - NIGHT 
The mess in this room rivals Harvey's. A few cats add to the clutter. Joyce lies on her disheveled bed and writes a letter. 
JOYCE (V.O.) Greetings from the second smallest state in the union, an endless plastics and nylon plantation controlled by giant chemical corporations. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. HARVEY'S APARTMENT - VESTIBULE - 1980'S - DAY 
HARVEY takes his mail out of the box. He finds an oddly decorated envelope. 
JOYCE (V.O.) To make matters more dismal, there are no decent comic book stores in my town, which is why my partner and I opened one ourselves. 
INT. HARVEY'S BATHROOM - 1980'S - DAY 
HARVEY finishes reading the letter sitting on the toilet. A cat runs around him. 
JOYCE (V.O.) Despite our steadily faltering business, my partner managed to sell the last copy of American Splendor #8 out from under me. I'm a big fan and I hate to wait for a new order. Is there any way I can get it from you direct? Sincerely, Joyce Brabner. 
Harvey scratches his head. He mutters to himself. 
HARVEY ...man, she's got good lookin' handwritin'... 
INT. HARVEY'S BEDROOM - 1980'S - NIGHT 
BEGIN MONTAGE -- HARVEY AND JOYCE COMMUNICATING 
We see Harvey in his bed writing. 
HARVEY Dear Joyce, Thanks for the letter. Whattya do besides sellin' comics? 
THE SCREEN SPLITS TO ACCOMMODATE: 
INT. DELAWARE PRISON CLASSROOM - 1980'S - DAY 
We see Joyce standing in front of a GROUP OF PRISONERS. 
JOYCE (V.O.) I'm a sometime activist and I teach writing to prisoners. I try to help them build an interior life and make art out of their monotonous, suffocating routine. 
THE SCREEN GIVES WAY TO ANOTHER FRAME 
INT. BUS - 1980'S - DAY 
Harvey scribbles a letter while riding on the bus. 
Joyce lets go of his hand. She stares at him in disbelief. 
CUT TO: 
INT. TGIF STYLE RESTAURANT - 1980'S - NIGHT 
The most awkward date in history. Seated in an ultra-yuppie restaurant filled with business lunchers, Harvey and Joyce hide behind their menus. While everyone else looks slick and successful, these two compete for the world's worst posture. 
HARVEY What's wrong? 
JOYCE Nothing. 
HARVEY Somethin's wrong. Yer lookin' around everywhere. 
JOYCE I guess I never imagined you eating in a place like this. 
HARVEY Me? I never been here. I thought you'd like it. But obviously ya don't, do ya? 
JOYCE It's fine. What difference does it make? 
Harvey shakes his head, feeling more pessimistic. 
HARVEY I dunno. None, I guess. (beat) They sure got a lot of meat on this menu. 
JOYCE You're a vegetarian? 
HARVEY Kinda. I mean ever since I got a pet cat, I couldn't eat animals anymore. 
Joyce grabs a bread stick. 
JOYCE Hmm. I support and identify with groups like PETA, but unfortunately I'm a self-diagnosed anemic. Also, I have all these food allergies to vegetables that give me serious intestinal distress. I guess I have a lot of borderline health disorders that limit me politically when it comes to eating. 
Harvey just stares at her. 
HARVEY Wow. Yer a sick woman, huh? 
JOYCE Not yet. But I expect to be. Everyone in my family's got some kind of degenerative illness. 
A cheery waitress bounces over. 
WAITRESS (sing song) Good afternoon! I'm your server Cindy! What can I bring you two today? 
They slowly look up at her. 
CUT TO: 
INT. HARVEY'S APARTMENT - 1980'S - NIGHT 
JOYCE and HARVEY enter the apartment. The place is a mess, as usual. 
HARVEY Look, I was gonna clean up, but why should I give you any false notions? The truth is I got a serious problem with cleanliness. I could wash a dish ten times and it'd still dirty. They even kicked me outta the Army 'cause I couldn't learn ta make a bed. 
Joyce puts down her bag. 
JOYCE I've seen worse. 
She slumps down on the sofa as if she's been here a million times. She rubs her head. Harvey sits next to her. 
JOYCE Harvey, go get me water and a few aspirin. 
Harvey just bounces back up and obeys. 
HARVEY What, ya got a headache? 
JOYCE No, but I want to avoid one. 
Harvey empties the aspirin bottle in his palm. For some reason, he's feeling more comfortable. 
HARVEY Well lemme tell ya Joyce, it sure is nice ta have company. I mean, despite all your problems, you seem like a great person. An' hey, sorry if my dating skills are kinda rusty, but I've just been through hell and back with women. I mean that last one turned out to be a real nasty bitch. 
Harvey arrives back with the aspirin. He hands it to Joyce. 
Harvey stands there waiting. 
HARVEY The girl at the Food Co-op picked me out all kinds of herbal stuff. One of 'ems good for stomachaches. Grandma Bear's Tummy Mint, I think. Are you still there? 
Joyce slowly opens the door. She leans against the door frame like she's just been through a war. 
She takes off her glasses and cleans them off with her shirt. 
JOYCE Harvey, we better skip this whole courtship thing and just get married. 
CUT TO: 
INT. HARVEY'S BEDROOM - 1980'S - DAY 
Harvey and Joyce are in bed, lying in each other's arms. 
They look quite contented. 
HARVEY Man, am I glad I talked you into comin' up here. Any more time alone and I mighta lost it fer good. 
JOYCE Me too. 
HARVEY So you don't have any problems with movin' to Cleveland? 
JOYCE Not really. I find most American cities depressing in the same way. 
HARVEY An' yer okay with the vasectomy thing? 
She shrugs. 
EXT. PARKING LOT - V.A. HOSPITAL - 1980'S - DAY 
HARVEY approaches the building. Instead of dragging his feet like usual, he seems to be floating on a cloud. We haven't seen Harvey this happy since... well, since never. 
He stops by a junker car and peeks in the window, finding TOBY eating lunch alone. He has an entire White Castle smorgasbord spread across the front seat. 
Harvey knocks on the window. Toby rolls it down. 
HARVEY Ay Toby. 
TOBY (mouth full) No you can't have any of my White Castle hamburgers so please don't even ask. 
HARVEY Can I have a fry? 
Harvey reaches for a handful of Toby's fries. 
TOBY Okay, but just a couple, Harvey. I'm not going to eat dinner until very late and this has got to hold me over. 
Harvey leans in, always amused by Toby. He steals another fry. 
HARVEY (munching) Whattya got, a church function? 
TOBY No, I'm driving to Toledo to see a movie. Would you like to come? 
HARVEY Nah. I gotta fly to Delaware tonight. I'm gettin' married. 
TOBY Oh. Why Delaware? 
HARVEY The chick I'm marryin' is from Wilmington. Plus, I gotta help her move her stuff here. (a beat) Why you drivin' ta Toledo to see a movie? 
TOBY It's not playing at the Mapletown. (a beat) I didn't know you had a girlfriend, Harvey. 
HARVEY Yeah. We met last week. 
Harvey opens the car door and slides in with Toby. 
HARVEY Toby, what movie could possibly be worth drivin' 260 miles round trip for? 
TOBY It's a new film called "Revenge of the Nerds." It's about a group of nerd college students who are being picked on all the time by the jocks, so they decide to take revenge. I already saw it once. 
HARVEY Wow, ya really dig this movie. 
HARVEY and JOYCE walk through the terminal. Harvey brims with energy but Joyce looks exhausted. 
REAL HARVEY (V.O.) If ya think readin' comics about yer life seems strange, try watchin' a play about it. God only knows how I'll feel when I see this movie. But truth be told, the play wasn't half bad, and we got a free trip outta it. Things were goin' pretty good for a change. Variety called me "The Blue Collar Mark Twain," and Doubleday was interested in publishing an anthology of "American Splendor." 
CUT TO: 
INT. AIRPORT - BAGGAGE CLAIM - 1980'S - DAY 
Harvey nervously taps his foot as he waits for the bags. 
Joyce leans against the carousel staring at a YOUNG MOTHER with a BABY in a Bjorn. 
HARVEY I hate checkin' bags, man. It always takes forever. 
He checks his watch. Joyce remains quiet and distant. 
HARVEY Jesus, look at the time. The bus is gonna leave soon and there won't be another one for an hour. That means I gotta shell out an extra thirty bucks for a cab. 
Harvey spots a bag that he thinks is his. 
HARVEY Hey wait, there's our -- (a well-dressed man grabs it) Figures. That lucky Yuppie's gonna get on the bus in time. 
Suddenly, Joyce mumbles something to Harvey. 
JOYCE Y'know Harvey, vasectomies are reversible. 
HARVEY (ignoring her) Damn Yuppies get everything. 
JOYCE (raising her voice) Are you listening to me? I said vasectomies are reversible. 
Heads turn. 
HARVEY What? Whattya talkin' about? I don't want kids. An' I came clean about my vasectomy the first time I set eyes on ya', right here in this airport. 
More heads turn. 
JOYCE I know but things have changed. I think we can be a family. 
HARVEY Family?! What kinda family could we possibly be? I ain't no good with kids. I can barely take care of myself. 
JOYCE I'll take care of the kid and you. 
HARVEY (dead serious) No way Joyce. Forget it. I can't do it; I can't have no kids. 
Joyce folds her arms... dejected, defeated. The audience of eavesdroppers looks disappointed as well. 
CUT TO: 
INT. HARVEY'S LIVING ROOM - 1980'S - DAY 
If the place was a disaster before, believe it or not, it's gotten worse. JOYCE seems to have given up on her organizing... and everything else for that matter. 
HARVEY hysterically searches through the mess for a record album. Joyce just lies listlessly on an open futon on the middle of the room; it looks as if she hasn't been up in days. 
HARVEY Where the hell is that Ornette Coleman album, Joyce? I got a review due tomorrow. 
Joyce rolls over. 
JOYCE I didn't touch it, Harvey. Would you let me sleep? 
HARVEY But it's one o'clock! How late can a person sleep? 
Joyce sits up. This time she means business. 
JOYCE It happens to be Saturday you selfish sonofabitch! And don't you go telling me what to do. I'm the one who moved into your city, into your home, into your vasectomy and into your screwed- up life. The least you could do is allow me to live here my way. 
She rolls over and covers her head with the pillow. Harvey just stands there staring at her. 
CUT TO: 
INT. SUPERMARKET - 1980'S - DAY 
HARVEY tries on outfits for the big show. He pulls a wrinkled T-shirt over his head and models it for JOYCE who is spread out on the bed surrounded by piles of clothing, scissors and sewing supplies. She glances up at Harvey's getup and shakes her head no. 
HARVEY Aw, c'mon. Who the hell cares? 
Harvey tosses his shirt over to Joyce, who snatches it and starts cutting it with a scissor. 
HARVEY Hey, whattya doin? 
JOYCE Merchandising. 
She resumes her mysterious sewing project; she seems to be making some kind of doll. 
CUT TO: 
INT. GREEN ROOM - NBC STUDIOS - 1980'S - DAY 
Backstage, JOYCE watches LATE NIGHT WITH DAVID LETTERMAN on a monitor as HARVEY awaits his turn to go on camera. He has changed out of his wrinkled T-shirt into a slightly more formal look -- a denim shirt and a ratty seersucker striped jacket. 
LETTERMAN SHOW - STOCK FOOTAGE 
ANGLE ON MONITOR (NOTE: THIS IS ACTUAL STOCK FOOTAGE OF THE SHOW) 
A 1980's DAVID LETTERMAN wisecracks. 
INT. GREEN ROOM - NBC STUDIOS - 1980'S - DAY 
Neither Joyce nor Harvey look particularly impressed with the whole deal. 
JOYCE People like this show? 
Harvey paces. 
HARVEY I'm gettin' hungry back here. They oughtta leave ya donuts or somethin'. 
A nervous STAGE MANAGER wearing a headset peeks his head in. 
STAGE MANAGER Dave's ready for you now, Mr. Pekar. 
HARVEY Hey, you got anything ta eat? My stomach's growling. 
STAGE MANAGER (checking his watch) There's no time to eat now. 
Harvey glances at the monitor just as Letterman announces his next guest. 
LETTERMAN SHOW - STOCK FOOTAGE 
LETTERMAN Okay. Our next guest works as a file clerk in a Cleveland hospital. 
INT. GREEN ROOM - NBC STUDIOS - 1980'S - DAY 
The stage manager grabs Harvey by the arm. Joyce stops them. 
JOYCE Wait a minute. Where's the doll? 
HARVEY He's got it at the desk. Will you relax about that already? 
STAGE MANAGER Guys, guys, we're in a hurry here. 
The Stage Manager physically pushes Harvey out of the Green Room. Joyce turns back to face the monitor. 
LETTERMAN SHOW - STOCK FOOTAGE 
ANGLE ON MONITOR 
Letterman holds up a copy of a full-size glossy AMERICAN SPLENDOR ANTHOLOGY. 
LETTERMAN ...He also writes comic books which detail his day-to-day pains and pleasures, and this is an anthology of nine of those comics. It's entitled AMERICAN SPLENDOR... From off the streets of Cleveland, please say hello to Harvey Pekar. 
THE HARVEY PEKAR WHO WALKS ONTO THE SET IS NOT THE ACTOR PORTRAYING HIM BUT RATHER THE REAL HARVEY PEKAR (only about 15 years younger). THIS IS ACTUAL STOCK FOOTAGE FROM HARVEY'S FIRST LETTERMAN APPEARANCE. 
INT. GREEN ROOM - NBC STUDIOS - DAY 
The Audience can't believe this guy's holding his own with Letterman. 
INT. GREEN ROOM - NBC STUDIOS - 1980'S - DAY 
ANGLE ON LETTERMAN REGULAR 
LETTERMAN REGULAR (to Joyce) At least he's keeping up with Letterman. 
JOYCE Pandering is more like it. 
Suddenly, Joyce walks over to the monitor and looks for the channel. She hits a button, but it only changes the frame of the show. 
JOYCE Damnit. 
LETTERMAN REGULAR Excuse me, but what are you doing? 
JOYCE I'm trying to get some news. You know there's a big story about to break about the US selling arms to Iran and the Contras. 
LETTERMAN REGULAR That's a monitor. 
JOYCE Ugh. Just forget it. 
Joyce gives up. She sinks back into her seat and pulls a book from her bag. The Letterman Regular stares at her like she's from Mars. 
LETTERMAN SHOW - STOCK FOOTAGE 
ANGLE ON THE MONITOR 
LETTERMAN Harvey, I know you've got a job. I've got a job. We're both very lucky. We both have jobs. 
HARVEY Then what's the matter? 
Once again laughs and a big round of applause. Letterman pulls out Joyce's mysterious doll and props it up on the table. 
LETTERMAN We've gotta go. Harvey I like you. I'm on your side. I enjoy the comic books. And here, quickly tell us about the little doll here. 
HARVEY My wife made it. 
INT. GREEN ROOM - NBC STUDIOS - 1980'S - DAY 
BACK TO JOYCE. 
She suddenly perks up. 
JOYCE Finally something good. (to Letterman Regular) Watch this. 
LETTERMAN SHOW - STOCK FOOTAGE CLOSE-UP OF THE DOLL 
It is an absolutely horrific but oddly evocative "Harvey Rag Doll." His face is inspired by Crumb's drawings of Harvey but even more extreme. His little T-shirt reads, "American Splendor." The Audience is in stitches. 
LETTERMAN They're made out of your old clothing. 
HARVEY That's right. 
LETTERMAN And what do these go for? 
HARVEY Thirty-four bucks. 
LETTERMAN (shocked) Thirty-four dollars? Thirty-four dollars for this? 
HARVEY What are ya cheap. You cheaper than me? 
LETTERMAN Would you pay thirty-four dollars for that? 
HARVEY No but I'm not asking it. My wife is. 
BACK TO: 
INT. GREEN ROOM - NBC STUDIOS - 1980'S - DAY 
JOYCE stares at the monitor, expressionless. The STAGE MANAGER sticks his head in. 
HARVEY (threatening) Okay, asshole. You'll pay for that one... 
Harvey takes off his shirt. He pulls another t-shirt out of the bag and changes ... 
LETTERMAN REGULAR (O.S.) Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome back, Harvey Pekar. 
Harvey's new t-shirt reads "ON STRIKE AGAINST NBC." He takes off for the stage, fists clenched, a soldier marching off to war. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. GREEN ROOM - NBC STUDIOS - 1980'S - DAY 
We're positioned behind the monitor, so we can only hear the show. THE STAGE MANAGER AND TWO PRODUCTION ASSISTANTS straighten up in the room. 
HARVEY (O.S.) Hey, Dave! You wanna know what my politics are? I'm a strident leftist, Dave. 
LETTERMAN (O.S.) I could have guessed half of that. 
HARVEY (O.S.) You coulda guessed all of it, man! So why don't we talk about your parent company, G.E., huh? Let's talk about anti-trust violations and nuclear reactors! 
STAGE MANAGER Joe, put more sodas in the fridge, there. And let's clean up the counters. That Pekar guy's a pig. 
As the P.A.'s walk back and forth in front of the monitor, we hear the Letterman / Pekar banter grow louder. 
Suddenly PRODUCTION ASSISTANT #2 stops and checks out the monitor. 
PRODUCTION ASSISTANT #2 Whoa... you guys. Check this out. 
INT. TOBY'S LIVING ROOM - 1980'S - DAY 
TOBY and his GRANDMOTHER watch HARVEY raise hell on Letterman. Again, we can't see the screen. 
HARVEY (O.S.) You're a cop-out, Letterman. You're nothin' but a shill for G.E. 
Toby's grandmother passes him a plate of cookies. 
LETTERMAN (O.S.) First of all, Harvey, what you are saying is not true. Second of all, this is not the place to say it. If you want to talk about this, go somewhere else, because you're not talking about it here!! 
CUT TO: 
INT. MR. BOAT'S KITCHEN - 1980'S - DAY 
Dressed in a bathrobe, Mr. Boats eats a lonely, late-night snack (cake and milk) at his kitchen table. A 12" TV on the table has Harvey and Dave on. 
HARVEY (O.S.) Don't worry, Dave. I won't come back unless you beg me. 
LETTERMAN (O.S.) You're not coming back at all. 
HARVEY (O.S.) What do I care -- 
LETTERMAN (O.S.) Because we've given you many, many chances to talk about things that would be of general interest to people -- 
HARVEY (O.S.) So what?! 
Mr. Boats shakes his head. 
INT. TOWN CAR - 1980'S - DAY 
We see Harvey alone, slumped in the back seat of a Town Car, heading back towards his hotel. City lights pass over his troubled face. We still hear the show, as if it's now in his head. 
LETTERMAN (V.O.) -- And also to promote your little Mickey Mouse magazine. Your little weekly reader! But you've blown every chance you've got. You're a dork, Harvey! 
HARVEY (V.O.) Dave, you're fulla shit! You're fulla shit!! 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. HARVEY'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - 1980'S - NIGHT 
CLOSE ON AN AMERICAN SPLENDOR COMIC 
The cover depicts a snarling LETTERMAN yelling, "YOU FUCKED UP A GREAT THING!" at a smirking, self-satisfied HARVEY. 
HARVEY I can't do that. I'm just not strong enough... I just wanna die. 
Joyce folds her arm. 
JOYCE Fine. I'll do it without you. 
INT. HARVEY'S BEDROOM - 1980'S - DAY 
HARVEY and JOYCE lay there quietly, both exhausted. Joyce turns over so her back faces Harvey. He puts his arm around her. 
ANGLE ON JOYCE'S FACE 
A tear drips down her cheek. 
CUT TO: 
INT. HARVEY'S APARTMENT - 1980'S - DAY 
Joyce is straightening up the apartment. The place actually looks halfway decent. 
THE DOORBELL RINGS 
Joyce opens the door. A guy in his 30's named FRED -- Hells Angels tough guy meets sensitive artist -- stands at the door. He's accompanied by a seven-year-old girl, DANIELLE. 
FRED Hey, I'm Fred. You called me about the comic book? 
JOYCE Right -- the artist. Come on in. 
FRED This is my daughter, Danielle. I had to bring her along. I hope you don't mind. 
Joyce leans down and addresses the girl, who holds a toy horse. 
JOYCE Hi, Danielle. What's that you're holding? 
DANIELLE A pony. 
It's immediately obvious that Joyce is great with kids. 
JOYCE A pony? What's his name? 
DANIELLE She's a girl. Clarissa. 
JOYCE Oh, I see. Well, I'm Joyce. Nice to meet both you and Clarissa. 
They all walk towards the table which is covered with papers. 
FRED I'm really sorry to hear about Harvey. Is he here? 
JOYCE He's going to work until next week, when he starts the chemo. That's why I wanna get this project started now. Once he's stuck here, I know he'll take over. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. HARVEY'S APARTMENT - 1980'S - LATER 
Miserable and in a daze, HARVEY walks up to his front door. 
He looks like a man whose days are numbered. When he reaches the door, he searches his pockets for keys. 
ANGLE ON POCKET 
Harvey's hand comes up empty. 
HARVEY Shit! 
Harvey tries the doorknob, but it's locked. 
He steps back on the lawn and looks around. Could he have dropped them? He retraces a few steps. 
HARVEY Damnit! 
Harvey yells up at the window. 
BACK TO MORE COMIC PANELS: 
1) An enraged Harvey throws things around the house. 
2) Joyce on the bed crying, a cat licking her back. 
CUT TO: 
INT. HARVEY'S SHOWER - 1980'S - DAY 
A balding Harvey depressed in the shower. He holds a clump of hair in his hand. 
CUT TO: 
COMIC PANEL OF THE ABOVE SCENE 
Harvey in the shower. The balloon above his head reveals his inner turmoil over losing his hair and his face swelling. 
MORE COMIC PANELS FOLLOW 
Harvey in agony. Various positions of him in bed, on all fours, covered with a case of shingles. "I feel like I'm on fire" appears over his head. 
CUT TO: 
INT. HARVEY'S KITCHEN - 1980'S - DAY 
Joyce and Fred go over some more comic art. Joyce carries the idea over to Harvey (wearing a baseball cap), who can't get out of the couch. He looks it over and nods. Danielle brings Harvey a glass of water. 
CUT TO: 
MORE COMIC PANELS: 
Harvey crawling up the steps. "I'm so weak I can't make it," he thinks... 
Harvey and Joyce in a hospital waiting room. He's slumped over, she has her hand on him. 
A delirious Harvey surrounded by nurses and Joyce. "She's torturing me, she won't let me die, I wanna die..." 
CUT TO: 
INT. HARVEY'S BATHROOM - 1980'S - DAY 
A balding Harvey lies on his bathroom floor. His cat walks all over him. 
HARVEY I wanna die... just let me die... 
CUT TO: 
MORE COMIC PANELS: 
Joyce attempts to wake Harvey up. She curses at him. She slaps him. "Why are you doing this to me!" 
A drawing of Joyce, doubled over, crying. "I can't take this anymore..." 
THE MONTAGE ENDS WITH A SCENE IN HARVEY'S BEDROOM 
CUT TO: 
INT. HARVEY'S BEDROOM - 1980'S - NIGHT 
A repeat of the opening scene... Like a ghost, a naked HARVEY stands over his bed staring down at a sleeping JOYCE. 
In the eerie light, he's almost translucent. 
HARVEY (faintly) Joyce... Joyce? 
Joyce springs up, alarmed. 
JOYCE What's wrong, Harvey? What are you doing up? 
Harvey just stands there for a moment saying nothing. 
INT. TOWER BOOKS - 1980'S - DAY 
FADE IN: 
CLOSE UP: A GLOSSY, FULL-COLOR, NOVEL-SIZED COMIC COVER. 
Scrawled across the top in yellow and red it read, "Our Cancer Year." The drawing depicts Harvey doubled over on the front lawn, groceries in the snow, with Joyce attempting to help him up. A hand flips the book open and signs the inside leaf. 
JOYCE and a healthy-looking HARVEY sit at a table signing copies of their opus. About fifteen or so people mill about with copies. 
REAL HARVEY (V.O.) Here's our man a year later. Somehow I made it through the treatments, an' the doctors are optimistic. I guess Joyce was right about doin' the big comic book. We published the thing as a graphic novel -- our first collaboration -- and ended up with rave reviews. We even won the American Book Award. Go figure... 
CUT TO: 
INT. HARVEY'S LIVING ROOM - 1980'S - DAY 
The place is still a mess but somehow it has a better vibe than it had before. This might be due to the presence of DANIELLE. She sits crossed legged on the floor making jewelry out of beads. JOYCE guides her. 
HARVEY shuffles into the room. He watches for a moment as Joyce and Danielle play. 
ANGLE ON JOYCE: There is an awkward expression almost resembling a smile on her face. He interrupts them. 
HARVEY Hey Joyce. 
Joyce looks up. Harvey looks like he's trying to hide something. 
JOYCE What is it Harvey? 
HARVEY That was the doctor. 
Joyce stops what she's doing and gulps. She hangs on Harvey's every word. 
HARVEY He said I'm all clear. 
Tears well in Harvey's eyes. Joyce breathes a sigh of relief and Danielle jumps up and runs over to Harvey. She hugs him. 
CUT TO: 
INT. CLEVELAND ICE RINK - 1980 - DAY 
HARVEY sits in the bleachers, watching JOYCE teach DANIELLE to ice skate. 
Harvey's got a box of pizza next to him. He picks up a slice and chomps on it. The cheese drips out of his mouth onto his shirt. 
REAL HARVEY (V.O.) The weirdest thing that came outta my illness was Danielle. With her real mother runnin' around who knows where, an' seein' how well her and Joyce got on, Fred decided she'd have a better life with us. I was scared at first but then I thought, what the hell. She's a good kid. So we ended up takin' her an' raising her as our own. 
CUT TO: 
INT. HARVEY'S APARTMENT - 1980'S - DAY 
HARVEY and DANIELLE lie on the futon together. Harvey's comics are strewn around the room everywhere. Danielle flips through one. 
HARVEY Ya keep readin' 'em backward. 
DANIELLE I like reading them backward. (holding up a comic) Is that you? 
HARVEY I keep tellin' ya, all of 'ems me, man. 
DANIELLE You look like a monster. 
HARVEY Yeah, well wait'll ya see what you're gonna look like. 
DANIELLE Me?? 
HARVEY Sure. Yer part of the story too, now. 
DANIELLE What story? 
HARVEY The story of my life. 
Danielle makes a face.
