A machete slashes INTO FRAME.  An American in battered fedora and leather jacket, accompanied by two gunbearers, hacks his way through dense bush.  We see him from the back only.  He hacks an opening, bats fly out AT CAMERA and the bushes part, revealing huge overgrown stone letters -- the Mayan ruin look -- that spell "AIRPLANE II."

CUT TO: 
INT. TERMINAL 
Kruger and the Commissioner go up escalator. 
KRUGER And what do the boys on the board know about safety, Commissioner?  Let me talk to them.

The boy passes them and bounds up the stairs. 
INT. HOTEL ROOM 
CLOSEUP of Ted pacing. 
TED (to self) Next thing I know, I'm the chief test pilot for the XR-2300, NASA's first Mercury shuttle.  That is, until I report she's got more flaws than the Titanic. 
LOOSEN slowly to find the Cross empty and the man who was on it hanging, his feet dangling next to Ted. 
TED Now I'm testing old F-l8s for some crazy Generalissimo who thinks there's a commie behind every tree in the Amazon. 
SUDDENLY the boy bursts in. 
BOY Senor Ted!  Look! 
Ted spins and the paper stays still.  He stops. 
TED My God!  They're launching the ZR-2300. Do you know what that is, Jose? 
BOY The muffler bracket for a '78 Pinto. 
TED No, that's an XR-2200.  The XR-2300 is the Mercury shuttle.  They can't do it! 
EXT. HOTEL MONTENEGRO 
Ted races out. 
TED Taxi! 
SFX:  A DOZEN CARS SCREECH AND CRASH INTO EACH OTHER.  HORNS STICK. 
ANGLE ON PILE OF CARS 
Ted jumps into the taxi on bottom of pile.  The driver POUNDS on his HORN -- it CONTINUES TO BLARE as they pull away, dragging other taxis. 
TED Houston, Texas. 
DRIVER Houston, Texas, senor?? 
TED Right at the corner, left at the light. Here's a map and step on it! 
Ted throws a map onto the floor of the front seat.  The driver steps on the map. 
EXT. TERMINAL, PASSENGER ARRIVALS - NIGHT 
An old truck loaded high with furniture pulls up.  A YOUNG MAN and his PARENTS, looking like the family from THE GRAPES OF WRATH, get out. 
SON We finally made it, Ma.  Mercury.  We're gonna start all over agin.  A whole new life. 
MUSIC:  OPTIMISTIC. 
SON Where the soil is rich. 
He bends down and takes a handful of earth from the terminal sidewalk and lets it run through his fingers. 
SON And the union strong.  Where men are free to realize their true potential. 
A black PORTER approaches and grabs a bag at the bottom of their pile of junk. 
PORTER Can I help you? 
SON Where black men and white men, working together, can move mountains. 
The Porter pulls the bag and the entire mountain of junk cascades to the ground. 
ANGLE ON TED'S TAXI ARRIVING 
It is covered in mud, flames shoot out from under the hood, the HORN BLARES.  The driver flips off the meter which reads, "874,567,004,500,000,000."  The numbers run off the meter along a special attachment. 
DRIVER That'll be eight hundred and seventy-four zillion quastavitas. 
ANGLE ON SAMMY DAVIS 
A white patient in lots of gold chains.  A Nurse stands over him and pulls a long oil dip-stick from his mouth, checks it, wipes it off and replaces it. 
RETURN TO SCENE 
TED Elaine, when are you going to realize Simon Kurtz put me in here to get me out of the way. 
ELAINE And when are you going to realize, Ted, that your mental hygiene is the most important thing right now. 
VOICE (O.S.) (ranting) It works... No, it doesn't... Yes, it does. 
ELAINE What's his problem? 
ANGLE 
On BEARDED MAN in rags chained to wall. 
MAN It does work... No, it doesn't. 
ANGLE 
On Ted and Elaine. 
TED His name's David Stockman.  He's been here twenty years, that's all he says. 
ELAINE Ted, you must remember what the doctor said, the first step on the road to sanity is admitting that you're sick.  Now take your electro-shock and you'll be back at the space center in no time.  And by the way, Ted, I'm leaving you for Simon. 
Ted gags on his spaghetti. 
ELAINE I just can't go on living with a man who refuses to deal with reality, Ted.  I have to go now.  Believe me, it's best for all concerned. 
Elaine leans over to kiss Ted.  He turns away. 
TED No goodbyes, Elaine.  Just go. 
ELAINE If that's the way you want it. 
TED That's the way I want it.  Just turn the radio on and go. 
ELAINE Goodbye, Ted.  I don't want to hurt you. 
Elaine flips a switch by the bed thinking it's the radio. It's the "ELECTRO-SHOCK."  Ted goes into convulsions as she leaves. 
DISSOLVE BACK TO: 
TED AT TERMINAL 
He rubs his temples. 
INT. TERMINAL - OUTSIDE BOOKSTORE 
Frank Morgan kisses JANE DENNIS, his mistress.  In b.g. is a bookstore window with a display of yellow covered books with plain black titles and a sign advertising, "NO-NAME BOOKS." 
Visible titles include:  "DEEP BOOK," "FASCINATING BOOK," "THE WORLD ACCORDING TO JOHN DOE."  A man next to the window reads a newspaper with headline, "SENSELESS MURDER UP 99% AND RISING!" 
FRANK Carol's not going to give me a divorce that easily, Jane. 
JANE I'm worried about her, Frank.  She could do something senseless, something violent. 
FRANK You're the one who's not making sense, Jane.  Carol's not the violent... 
Frank sees CAROL. 
FRANK Carol! 
Carol whips out a gun. 
FRANK No!  This is senseless! 
CAROL 
FIRES.  Jane faints.  Other women nearby faint.  Two S.W.A.T. cops faint.  Carol bolts.  The newspaper, b.g., clicks over from 99% to 120%. 
INT. TERMINAL - ANOTHER AREA 
Ted pushes through crowd and passes a spherical booth with sign that reads, "ORGASMIC EXPERIENCES, 25¢."  MRS. GOOCH, an elderly woman, stops Ted next to the booth door. 
MRS. GOOCH Young man, would you have change for a twenty? 
TED (going for his wallet) I might have two tens. 
MRS. GOOCH Thank you anyway, but I wanted it in quarters. 
Ted keeps moving past a police line which has gone up around Frank Morgan's body.  We HOLD on the murder scene.  A DETECTIVE kneels beside the body which now has a chalk mark around it. 
SERGEANT (lookind down at Detective) When is this senseless killing going to stop? 
DETECTIVE HALLICK Senseless or not, Sergeant, there's a pattern here.  This is the 12th victim this week with a chalk mark around the body.  I want this whole area cordoned off!  I want everyone in this terminal booked and beaten until they talk.  I want an M.O. on everyone who has seen THE SOUND OF MUSIC and I want the entire population of Hawaii off that rock and into the water within one hour. 
Hallick stands up and finds the area surrounded by 30 accordian players playing "Lady of Spain." 
DETECTIVE HALLICK Sergeant.  I said cordon off, not accordian off!  Now dust this area for prints. 
One cop pulls out a duster and dusts the wall.  Other cops follow after him hanging prints by Picasso, Lautrec, etc. 
DETECTIVE HALLICK And run a check on their plates. 
A cop looks at people's upper false teeth plates. 
DETECTIVE HALLICK (TO CAMERA) When will this senseless killing end? 
A POLICE PHOTOGRAPHER straddles the body and shoots it "BLOW-UP" style. 
EXT. TERMINAL - LOADING AREA 
Ground crew lift passengers who are stacked on a luggage tram and heave them onto a conveyor belt leading up to the ship. 
INT. TERMINAL 
JOE SALUCCI (imagine Van Heflin) bids his WIFE (imagine Cher) goodbye.  Joe is very nervous, sweating a lot.  His Wife hands him a few crumpled bills. 
WIFE Take this, Joey.  It's my last few bucks. You'll need a hot meal when you get there. 
JOE We've spent everything on these operations.  Is it really worth it?  We've pawned your mother's wedding ring.  The kids have no winter clothes... 
WIFE (holding a finger to his lips) Joey, what's more important, the kids' clothes or your sexual potency. 
JOE (anxiously looking around) I don't want to hear that word! 
WIFE Okay, Joey.  The Doc says you gotta relax. This hospital in Des Moines is the best sex clinic in the country. 
JOE All right. (hands her an envelope) Here. 
WIFE What...? 
JOEY Insurance.  Everyone buys it. 
MUSIC:  DRAMATIC STING. 
WIFE All right.  Goodbye, Babe. 
She kisses him.  He recoils, wipes off his mouth, and leaves.  She looks at the envelope, then yells at him through the crowd. 
WIFE Joey!  Remember, sexual impotence is nothing to be ashamed of! 
The entire terminal looks at him. 
INT. TERMINAL STORAGE ROOM 
Ted is tied to a chair surrounded by packing crates -- one is stamped "JIMMY HOFFA, THIS END UP" with the arrow pointing to the ground.  Ted struggles to free his hands. 
INT. TERMINAL GIFT SHOP 
Joe Salucci stands at the counter. 
JOE (to Cashier) Time, Newsweek, the Lifesavers, and the second time bomb from the right. 
He points at the shelf behind the Cashier where a number of bombs are on display. 
ANGLE ON CANDY MACHINE IN GIFT SHOP 
The actual DR. BENJAMIN SPOCK stands in front of the machine.  Next to the machine at the magazine rack is a red- bearded MAN in tweed jacket and a tartan kilt reading a magazine titled "GAY SCOTS."  Spock puts a coin in the machine and it explodes in sparks and smoke like the bridge panel on "STAR TREK." 
SCOTT (Scottish accent) My God, Dr. Spock!  You've got a meltdown in the Reggie Bars! 
INT. TERMINAL CORRIDOR 
Joe Salucci snaps his attache case closed.  Wipes the sweat from his brow.  Takes out a "Des Moines" ticket and throws it away.  Looks at another ticket -- "Mercury."  Takes a last drag from his cigarette, throws it on the ground and hurries off.  The cigarette rolls under the "STORAGE ROOM" door. 
INT. STORAGE ROOM 
Ted, tied in chair, watches the cigarette roll up to some oil rags.  They burst into flame.  The flames lap up against a yellow oil drum labeled "EXPLOSIVE."  PAN to three more drums labeled, "DYNAMIC!", "BRILLIANT!", "A MUST SEE!". 
INT. TERMINAL OUTSIDE STORAGE ROOM 
EDITH and DAVE WALTERS, a middle-aged couple, carry their hand luggage.  Edith appears very nervous. 
DAVE I'm telling you, Edith, space travel is safer than driving a car. 
The storage room door EXPLODES open in front of them.  Ted flies out with the debris.  Edith faints.  Ted gets up, brushes himself off and heads to the ticket counter just as the ticket agent flips a sign over that reads, "MERCURY -- SOLD OUT."  Ted spots a SCALPER and reaches for his wallet. 
SCALPER Mercury seats.  I got a pair.  I got aisle seats, window seats.  Check 'em out. 
INT. SHUTTLE COCKPIT - MORNING 
Computerized panels line all walls.  Windows are similar to an airplane -- outside carwash brushes soap down the nose. The "HOT WAX" sign flashes.  Two attendants wipe windows with soap gloves and move to the DISTANT STRAINS of "CAR WASH."  Elaine sits at computer, two other CREW are in their seats.  Simon enters with Oveur. 
SIMON Gentlemen, this is Captain Oveur.  He's taking over for Frank Morgan. 
MR. UNGER What's the problem? 
SIMON Morgan was senselessly murdered about an hour ago. 
Elaine gasps. 
MR. DUNN (black, sports afro) Murdered?  I hope it's not serious. 
SIMON We won't know until after the autopsy. 
MR. DUNN Of course.  Welcome aboard, sir.

OVEUR Yes, sir, commander. (into radio) This is Mercury One.  Everything seems A- okay up here and ready for count-down. 
ZOOM to CLOSEUP of Elaine's face. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. HOSPITAL GROUNDS - DAY 
Dr. Rumack and Elaine walk across the well-groomed lawn. Elaine carries a box of spaghetti-to-go.  As they walk, they pass patients in wheelchairs pushed by nurses.  The further they walk, the more wheelchairs appear until the lawn is jammed with two hundred wheelchairs bumping into each other, patients falling out, total wheelchair chaos. 
ELAINE Ted seemed to get worse after I told him about Simon, Doctor. 
RUMACK The human brain is a highly complex organ, Elaine, perhaps the most complex next to the bladder. (he stops at a patient in a wheelchair with his back TO CAMERA) Let me show you. (Rumack removes the top of the patient's skull and takes out his brain as they continue on) Ted's problem is in this area. (points with a pencil) This area, this area, here, here, here, under here, here... 
The ship vibrates. 
CONTROLLER 1 (V.O.) You have lift-off, Mercury One. 
The G-force causes the crew's hair to go straight back. Dunn's afro straightens and stays back throughout flight.

The crew all look at the floor. 
OVEUR Elaine, ask ROK for a field interference scan.  Those sun spots might give us a problem with our communications.

The computer is labeled R.O.K. She seems to have a problem getting it to respond. 
ELAINE (to self) That's really strange.

INT. CABIN 
Mary moves down the aisle checking passengers.  She passes Father O'Flanagan who reads ALTERBOY magazine -- an alterboy in bikini bathing suit on cover.  She passes Mrs. Gooch who reads HIGH TIMES.  She stops at a ten-year-old GIRL. 
MARY I guess this is pretty exciting for you. 
GIRL Yes, it is.  How long will the trip take? 
MARY Our actual flight time is over fourteen months, but due to the time-space variant at sub-light speeds, our onboard flight time will be just over eighteen hours. 
Mary leaves and the Girl turns to the WOMAN beside her. 
GIRL Gee, Mom, how does that work? 
WOMAN (very tense) How many times do I have to tell you, I'm not your mother!  I've never seen you before! 
The Woman vibrates in multiple image and grabs her temple. 
GIRL (V.O.) Why did she yell at me like that? 
A MAN who looks like Robert Young sits down beside the Girl. 
MAN Hallucinating again, Rhonda? 
GIRL (taking a paper bag away from her face) I don't know what it is. 
MAN Maybe it's the brand of glue you've been sniffing.  Why don't you try this, NO-HI. It gives you all the pleasure of glue without the brain damage. 
ANGLE ON TESTA (ANOTHER FLIGHT ATTENDANT) 
She is completely bald. 
TESTA Something to read, sir? 
JOE (clutching his case) Do you have PSYCHO MONTH? 
Ted breathes deeply on an oxygen unit.  He stops, but we still hear deep breathing.  LOOSEN to find Father O'Flanagan smoking a joint.  He smiles and leaves. 
INT. CABIN 
Joe Salucci clutches his attache case and wipes his brow. Mary leans over him. 
MARY You should really put that case in the compartment above your head, sir. 
JOE (nervously) That's okay.

JOHN It's going to be terrific.  A whole new world, new kids to play with. 
ALICE You're going to love it, Jimmy. 
JIMMY No more headlines about the rape trial and the fraud charges? 
JOHN (starts to twitch) How many kids get a chance to live on another planet. 
JIMMY No more kids yelling, 'Your old man's a thieving rapist'? 
JOHN (grabbing Jimmy) Look, a man can make an honest mistake!! Anyway, she was asking for it!  They're all asking for it all the time!! 
ALICE (V.O.) Not John's irregularity again. 
INT. WASHROOM 
Ted throws water on his face, wipes it off with a towel while staring into himself in the mirror.  He sees the Psychiatrist in the mirror.  The Psychiatrist also washes up. 
PSYCHIATRIST You must admit that you're sick, Ted... sick, Ted... sick, Ted... 
The Psychiatrist looks for the echo. 
LOSE Psychiatrist.  Ted throws the paper towel into the toilet, and flushes.  The toilet sparks and smokes and keeps running.  The running gets more intense as Ted tries to stop it by hitting the handle.

ELAINE Ted.  I don't know why you got on this flight.  I don't know what you're trying to prove. 
TED Elaine, we have to go back. 
ELAINE We can't go back.  We had something very special, but it's all over. 
TED Elaine, I mean the mission has to be aborted.  This ship should never have passed FSA inspection.  This thing is held together by string and chewing gum. 
A cupboard door, labeled "EMERGENCY USE ONLY," swings open behind Elaine revealing shelves of gum and string.  Elaine shuts it without looking inside. 
MUSIC:  DRAMATIC STING. 
ELAINE Ted, get a grip on yourself.  You should never have left the hospital. 
TED Then you do think I'm insane. 
ELAINE I've never used the word insane, Ted. 
TED (facetiously) What word would you use, Elaine? 
ELAINE The word is sick.  Ted -- very, very, very sick. 
TED What would you say if I told you the toilet just blew up in my face. 
ELAINE I'd use the word insane. 
Simon leans over Oveur's shoulder. 
SIMON Now what? 
Scraps looks at Oveur.  Jimmy looks at the array of dials, etc. 
OVEUR That's an asteroid field.  There shouldn't be anything like that in this sector unless... 
Scraps looks at Simon. 
SIMON Unless? 
Scraps looks at Oveur.

OVEUR But we couldn't be off course.  Our coordinates are computer-locked barring... 
Scraps looks at Simon.

Scraps looks at Oveur. 
OVEUR Barring a computer failure.  There was talk of sub-par wiring in this ship.  I hope that's just talk. 
MUSIC:  DRAMATIC STING. 
Scraps' ears prick up. 
Simon moves past Jimmy, stops at the door and downs a handful of anti-fear pills before leaving.

JIMMY Scraps. 
OVEUR Can I hold him? 
JIMMY (handing over Scraps) Sure.

CONTROLLER 2 (approaching McCrosky) Here are the navigational charts, sir. 
McCROSKY Thanks. 
Another Controller passes.  McCrosky stops him. 
McCROSKY Get me a readout on their fuel capacity. 
CONTROLLER 3 Yes, sir. 
CONTROLLER 4 Here's all the available information on the sun.  That thing's hot, sir. 
McCrosky takes the info and burns his hand. 
SFX:  STEAM 
McCROSKY Ahhhhhh!  Get me Bud Kruger immediately! (spotting Jacobs) Jacobs, I want to know absolutely everything that's happened up till now! 
JACOBS First the earth cooled.  Then the dinosaurs came but were too big and died and everything got rotten and turned into oil and the Arabs bought Mercedes Benzs and then there was the best TV special on Judy Garland.  Then we lost the war with Albania.  Then... 
McCrosky leaves Jacobs babbling. 
McCROSKY Things sure haven't changed. 
McCrosky stands in front of a huge painting of himself. Both he and painting are in the same pose -- one hand loosens the tie, he drinks coffee with the other, a cigarette dangles from his lip. 
INT. CABIN - CLOSEUP OF TED 
He is lost in thought.  SUPER IMAGES:

Ted is shaken out of his dream by Elaine. 
ELAINE Ted, Ted.  Listen to me, Ted.  You were right all along.  Ted, we've lost the crew and Simon's turned to jelly! 
INT. CABIN - ANOTHER ANGLE 
Simon is a jelly mold inside a uniform. 
CONTROLLER 1 (V.O.) (on radio) Come in, Mayflower.  This is mission control.  Over.  Come in, Mayflower! Over! 
Jimmy pokes his head in. 
JIMMY Do you want to talk about it now, Commander? 
INT. CABIN - ANOTHER ANGLE 
Elaine stands over Ted looking at the empty bottle of stress pills. 
ELAINE My God. 
Stella approaches in nurse's uniform splattered with blood. A cigarette dangles from her lip.  She wipes her hands on a blood-splattered towel. 
STELLA He's finally come to terms with his own psychosis. 
ELAINE But he was right!  He's not crazy! 
STELLA Miss, I'm a nurse with a dying F-A-T-H-E- R, I know what I'm talking about.  Now I'm going to need fresh sheets, gauze, Q-tips, and all the vaseline you have on board! Now! 
Elaine leaves, looking back at Ted with empathy.  Mary passes. 
STELLA (to Mary) I'll need all the boiling water you can get your hands on! 
Mary leaves and a MAN passes holding a tattered arm. 
EXT. ANOTHER DARK STREET - CLOSEUP OF TED 
standing, looking at a bar.  The glow of flashing neon sign reflects off his face.  He pulls out a cigarette.  A woman's hand shoots INTO FRAME holding a lit zippo.  Ted draws deeply on the cigarette. 
TED (V.O.) There I was, minding my own business when I looked up and saw a pair of legs that went forever. 
ANGLE ON WOMAN'S FEET 
PAN UP AND UP AND UP.  She is all legs -- no torso, no head, just legs -- about two stories high. 
TED (V.O.) But I had a date with Harry's.  It was little more than a hole in a wall on the south side of Chicago. 
ANGLE ON A HOLE 
bashed in the side of a brick wall.  A neon sign over the hole reads, "HARRY'S GOODTIME BAR." 
INT. HARRY'S 
dark, smokey bar.  PAN very tough faces standing along the bar. 
TED (V.O.) Harry's was perfect for me.  The kind of place you go if you don't want to be recognized. 
KEEP PANNING tough faces, but now they all wear Groucho glasses and noses. 
TED (V.O.) It was rough, real rough. 
ANGLE ON POOL TABLE 
with four players -- all have broken thumbs in casts. 
TED (V.O.) The kind of place you could score anything, from junk... 
One guy hands another guy a large, rusted car fender for money. 
TED (V.O.) ...to Phil Donahue's book. 
PHIL DONAHUE signs a stack of books at a table. 
TED (V.O.) At Harry's you could count on a fight breaking out almost every night. 
TWO PROFESSORS argue at a table. 
PROFESSOR 1 And I say essence precedes existence. 
PROFESSOR 2 You're crazy!  Existence precedes essence. 
PROFESSOR 1 Essence! 
PROFESSOR 2 Existence! 
Professor 2 slugs Professor 1 sending him flying across the room.  Professor 1 gets up and throws a judo chop which Professor 2 stops by holding a book up in both hands.  The book splits in two like a piece of wood split by a karate chop. 
TED (V.O.) There was a small trio in one corner. 
Two midgets play light jazz -- piano and bass. 
TED (V.O.) And a larger trio in the other corner. 
Five 300-pound musicians play some tune in another corner. 
ANGLE ON TED AT BAR - CLOSEUP OF TED 
He pulls out a cigarette.  A bare foot with zippo held in toes comes INTO FRAME and lights it. 
TED The last thing I wanted was Elaine to see me down on my luck.  Well, it was just my luck.  In she walked with a group from the space program. 
ANGLE ON DOOR 
Elaine and Simon and two other couples, who look like clean- cut NASA types out of "The Right Stuff," walk in laughing and take a table. 
TED (V.O.) They'd come to Harry's to slum it and try their hand at the video bull. 
The group prod Elaine to try the bull.  A cowboy hat flies across the room.  She grabs it, pulls it on, and moves to the bull which is surrounded by others in cowboy hats. Elaine hops in the saddle.  A sinister character puts a quarter in and madly flips knobs. 
SFX:  VIDEO GAME 
The saddle doesn't move -- all the action is on the screen but Elaine throws one hand back and kicks her legs. 
TED (V.O.) Elaine made that ride look easy.  It was obvious why I was still nuts about her. She loved life.  I didn't want her to notice me so I borrowed a pair of dark glasses. 
Ted takes a pair of dark glasses off a passing blind man who walks perfectly until the glasses are gone, then starts stumbling and crashes over a table. 
TED (V.O.) Grabbed an alto sax and joined the group. 
Ted takes an alto sax from a passerby who also stumbles and crashes over a table when he loses his sax. 
TED (V.O.) I stayed in the background not wanting to draw attention to myself. 
Everyone looks around trying to see where the terrible grating sax sound is coming from. 
TED (V.O.) Then what happened?  Elaine's crowd talks her into joining us for a song. 
Elaine hops up on the stage, grabs a mike and starts to sing "Stormy Weather."  She sidles up to Ted and goes into a medley of old songs. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
HOURS LATER 
Elaine's singing is just as bad as Ted's sax.  They have cleared the joint and play and sing alone.  Elaine's group finally pull her out.  She hasn't recognized Ted. 
ELAINE (to Ted) I don't know who you are or how you lost your sight, but I'll never forget this night as long as I live. 
PULL BACK leaving Ted alone on the stage still playing. Chairs are turned up on tables.  One table has chairs turned up with the people still sitting in the chairs. 
STELLA (to a male passenger) I'm afraid that leg's going to have to come off. 
A leg is passed to her from OUT OF FRAME.  She takes it while still looking at the chart. 
STELLA Wait.  This isn't your chart.  You just had a touch of air sickness. (handing him back his leg) You'll be fine. 
A WOMAN sitting next to the MAN WHO IS HOLDING HIS LEG grabs Stella. 
WOMAN I'm terrified. 
STELLA (shakes her hand) And I'm a nurse.  Everything will be okay. Pass it on. 
The Man with the leg passes it to the passenger in seat behind. 
MAN WITH LEG Everything will be okay.  Pass it on. 
The leg gets passed from seat to seat as passengers say, "Everything will be okay.  Pass it on." 
CLOSEUP OF TED 
lying unconscious in a corner.  A puppy crawls INTO FRAME and starts licking his face.  LOOSEN TO FIND Jimmy standing over Ted.  Ted comes to, feels his jaw and pulls himself up. The ship jolts. 
JIMMY Are you feeling okay, mister? 
TED I'm feeling just fine, son.  Just fine. 
Ted pushes by Jimmy, a look of great purpose on his face. 
INT. COCKPIT 
Elaine enters looking for Simon. 
ELAINE Simon, I... 
The cockpit is empty. 
CONTROLLER 1 (V.O.) Do you read, Mayflower?  Over.  This is mission control.  Over.

TED Elaine, what's going on? 
ELAINE Ted, there's no time to explain. 
Ted picks up Oveur who is still gasping. 
OVEUR Packers... seven... Vikings... three... 
Ted drags him onto the floor and takes his seat. 
McCROSKY (V.O.) Come in, Mayflower!  Over! 
ELAINE Ted, I was wrong about you. 
They reach out and hold hands. 
McCROSKY (V.O.) Come in!  Over!  Come in!  Over! 
TED We all make mistakes, Elaine. 
McCROSKY (V.O.) Come in Mayflower! 
ELAINE How could I ever have doubted you? 
McCROSKY (V.O.) This is mission control!  Over! 
TED That's all behind us now, Elaine.  And no matter what happens, I want you to know I've always loved you. 
McCROSKY (V.O.) Jesus, would someone answer me!!

STELLA General Walker is here, Billy.  He wants to talk to you. 
GENERAL WALKER Billy, if we get through this thing alive, I'd like you to get this letter to my mother. 
He hands Billy a letter. 
INT. COCKPIT 
Elaine is monitoring various dials.  Ted is at controls and on the radio. 
TED (on radio) An electrical fire in the core has played havoc with the ROK-4000 computer.  It's locked us on a direct line with the sun and there's no way we can go to manual. Captain Oveur already tried it and he's... 
OVEUR (O.S.) (from floor) Giants sixty... Rams... zip... 
TED ... become an intolerable bore.  The rest of the crew has been lost ­and we're out of coffee.  Also, we're starting to feel the sun's heat pretty bad.

INT. MISSION CONTROL 
McCrosky sits at a monitor, talks into a mike and looks down at a book.  Behind him two Controllers make a dope deal -- a baggie of grass for cash.  We only see their midsections and hands. 
McCROSKY Striker, this is Jack McCrosky, chief controller.  I want you to listen to me and listen good. 
The buyer checks out the baggie -- it's mostly twigs.  The seller is trying to explain the situation with his hands. 
McCROSKY Twenty years ago I helped a young pilot through a storm over Chicago. 
The buyer grabs the seller's shirt and tries to get cash back.  A fight ensues. 
McCROSKY He didn't have a crew either.  He said he couldn't do it.  But when the going got tough that kid pulled it together. 
The seller's shirt is ripped.  Knives are pulled. 
McCROSKY You might have read about him; he made all the big papers and the Canadian Jewish News. 
The seller is stabbed. 
McCROSKY I don't know where he is today but if he was up there right now, I know he'd find some way to turn that bucket around and get the hell out of there, pronto!

ANGLE ON McCROSKY'S BOOK - "PEP TALKS FOR ALL OCCASIONS" 
McCrosky slams it shut. 
McCROSKY I just hope I said the right thing. 
TED (V.O.) I'm afraid you gave the wrong speech. McCrosky.  I'm not your problem.  It's this ship.  That computer's gone bananas. 
McCROSKY (holding up the book) Why the hell are we still using the old manual!  Burn this book! 
A smiling blonde man in a white sweater with "MORAL MAJORITY" on the front walks by and takes the book. 
McCROSKY (on radio) Just hold on, Striker, we'll get back to you.

TESTA The cabin temperature is rising.  The passengers want to know what's happening up here.

TED (into headset) Check. 
MR. COFFEE (V.O.) There's a terminal at the base of the coil.  That's your contact point. 
A PASSENGER bends down and picks a coffee bean off the floor. 
PASSENGER Is this a coffee bean?

She approaches very distressed looking. 
McCROSKY What makes you think your husband might want to blow up that shuttle, ma'am? 
She goes into her purse for the insurance form. 
MRS. SALUCCI This insurance policy. 
A large ivory colored vibrator drops out of her purse, hits the floor, and flips on.  They all look at it. 
MRS. SALUCCI An electric tooth. (handing McCrosky the insurance form) Joey was supposed to go to Des Moines for an operation to cure his impotence. 
McCROSKY The Des Moines Institute? 
MRS. SALUCCI Then you know it. 
KRUGER/McCROSKY/COMMISSIONER Yes, we're familiar with it.

If you blast here in the computer core and the fuselage doesn't give way here and the main communication lines to the cockpit hold here and this baby here doesn't jam this little old unit up here and throw about two tons of hot steel through here like a hot knife through butter and the upper and lower... 
McCROSKY What's your point, Sarg? 
SARG I have no point. 
McCROSKY Then it's settled.  The bomb is Striker's only chance.  Are there any questions?
