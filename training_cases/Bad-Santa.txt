FADE IN: 
Snow flakes falling against a black sky. 
CAMERA FOLLOWS THEM DOWNWARD TO REVEAL 
EXT. MILWAUKEE BAR - NIGHT 
It looks like a warm cozy place out of "It's A Wonderful Life". The window is flocked with fake snow, and hung with colorful Christmas lights, wreaths and ornaments. 
CAMERA PUSHES SLOWLY IN 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. MILWAUKEE BAR - NIGHT 
CAMERA CONTINUES MOVEMENT IN SAME DIRECTION 
TITLES BEGIN 
The barman, wiping down the counter, gives an occasional semi-furtive glance toward the far end of the bar. 
Other patrons chat near the bartender and also give occasional glances toward the far end of the bar. It is early evening -- happy hour -- and the clientele is well-heeled and sociable. 
A customer says something interrogative to the bartender, who looks down the bar and shrugs. 
REVERSE - CAMERA CONTINUES MOVEMENT (Notes the combination of the HIGH ANGLE and the tilt of Santa's head keep his face from being clearly revealed in this scene). 
Sitting alone at the far end of the bar, given a wide berth by the other customers, a man (WILLIE) stares morosely into his drink. The drink is clearly not his first. 
He wears a red velvet suit and red velvet hat with a white pom-pom. He has shiny black boots with red velvet trim. His long white beard is not real and is in fact pulled down below his chin to facilitate drinking. It exposes heavy black stubble. 
Swaying slightly, he raises the drink to the vicinity of his lips. Once it gets close he must navigate it in with some effortful coordination. He takes a sip and sets the drink carefully back down. 
After another long, staring, morose beat, he starts weeping. 
It is loud, dolorous, and unself-conscious. 
EXT. ALLEYWAY BEHIND THE MILWAUKEE BAR - NIGHT 
Santa staggers out the back door... 
CAMERA FOLLOWS BEHIND HIM still hiding his face. 
Santa gets about ten feet, then pauses and leans with one hand against the alley wall, uses the other to hold his pom- pom out of the way, and vomits. 
Having vomited, and spit, he staggers off toward the street. 
SUPERED TITLE OF THE MOVIE: 
BAD SANTA 
C.U. PHOTO PRINTING OUT 
The Photo Elf takes the digital photo and presents it to a MOM. 
PHOTO ELF (dutifully reciting his spiel) My, what a darling picture! Are you certain you only want the single? Additional photos come in handy as gifts for grandma and grandpa or a wonderful remembrance for friends. 
MOM That's all right, I'll just take the single. 
He takes her credit card as CAMERA MOVES OVER TO SANTA. On his knee is a YOUNG BOY who whispers excitedly in his ear. 
SANTA (disinterested) Uh-huh... yeah... done. 
Young Boy climbs off and runs away, A BRATTY KID jumps up on Santa's lap. 
BRATTY KID I saw you in another mall. 
SANTA (not even looking at him) Right... Good for you. 
BRATTY KID You're not really Santa. If you were Santa you could do magic. 
SANTA (looks at him) You want magic? 
Santa pushes him off his lap and shoves him on his way. 
SANTA There, I just made you disappear. 
Santa turns to his Elf, 
SANTA ...That it? 
The Elf nods as he peels off a pointed prosthetic ear. Santa pulls a fifth of Old Grandad from the cushions of his throne. 
SANTA ...Thank fuckin' Christ. 
He takes a swig. 
INT. MILWAUKEE DEPARTMENT STORE - NIGHT - LATER 
With the sound of closing circuits, banks of lights systematically shut down in the various departments of the now empty store. 
INT. MILWAUKEE DEPARTMENT STORE - EXIT AREA - NIGHT 
Downstairs the last of the store employees file out the door past an old SECURITY GUARD. Eventually Santa emerges. 
SECURITY GUARD Merry Christmas, Willie. 
SANTA Up your ass. 
The guard chuckles. 
SECURITY GUARD Have it your way, Willie. 
SANTA Don't tell me which way to have it. 
The Security Guard heads for a panel near the doorway and punches a key labeled ARM. An L.E.D. readout labeled "ARMING" counts down from 30 seconds. 
The guard exits the store, locks the door and heads home. 
INT. MILWAUKEE DEPARTMENT STORE - SANTA'S WORKSHOP - NIGHT 
A large Teddy bear sits under a Christmas tree. 
Suddenly - it moves, bolting upright and sprinting from the room. 
INT. MILWAUKEE DEPARTMENT STORE - DOWNSTAIRS - NIGHT 
The alarm continues to count down -- 15... 14... 
The Teddy bear slides down the space between the railing of the escalators. Landing on its feet, it barrels toward the door. 
HARRISON Aw, forget it! 
Harrison stomps away and right toward Marcus and Willie as they enter the store. 
HARRISON ...Hacks! 
Willie and Marcus stop in their tracks and watch the burly man storm out. Bob Chipeska watches with them. 
CHIPESKA Hi. Bob Chipeska. I, please, I, uh -- please don't listen to him. Great resume and photo by the way. 
MARCUS Thanks... you know, we been at this a long time an' all, so we like to think we do a good job... 
A Beautiful Girl wearing skin-tight pants walks by, catching Willie's eye. He stares wantonly at her ass, off in his own little world. 
CHIPESKA You two are the best men for the job. Truly. So do not let his... unpleasantness affect your performance in any way. 
MARCUS Oh no, we're fine, w -- 
WILLIE (irked, snapping out of his daydream) Performance? 
Willie's reaction worries Marcus. 
CHIPESKA Yea. Your performance... you know, the... 
WILLIE Performance. Like sexual? 
CHIPESKA Excuse me? 
MARCUS Willie no, he -- 
WILLIE You saying there's something wrong with my gear? 
MARCUS Willie... 
CHIPESKA I'm sorry. Your gear? 
WILLIE You know... fuck stick. 
MARCUS OKAY! We're gonna head upstairs now. 
Marcus shoves Willie, who stalks off. Marcus lingers to smooth things over. He forces a grin and shakes his head. 
MARCUS Such a card. 
CHIPESKA He's not gonna say "fuck stick" in front of the children, is he? 
MARCUS No, no, no. Joke. Adult joke. For us. Adults. 
A long, long, long silence. 
MARCUS ...Joke. 
Another beat. Marcus pantomimes helpless laughter, noiselessly throwing his head back and holding his gut as it heaves with mirth. 
He is instantly composed. 
INT. CHAMBERLAIN'S - WINTER WONDERLAND - DAY 
On an upper floor of Chamberlain's the theme is "The Desert as Winter Wonderland." Cacti and tumbleweeds are wrapped with lights and flocked with snow, and a team of nine stuffed burros are hitched to a sleigh. Rudolfo the Red Nosed Burro is tended by several Santa's elf mannequins. One in cowboy wear and another in a poncho and sombrero. 
Again there is a line of waiting children. Marcus makes his way through the line as kids gasp and cheer. He plays to the crowd. 
MARCUS Merry Christmas! Santa's coming! 
Yayyyyyy! Marcus gets to the head of the line, ducks under the velvet rope and goes behind the flimsy cardboard set. 
Willie sits there morosely, head slumped, forearms on knees, red velvet hanging limply from one hand. 
MARCUS What the fuck you doing, "fuck stick" in front of the boss? 
Still nothing. 
WILLIE ...Next, goddamnit! Let's move it along -- this is not the DMV! 
Marcus walks over to the rope. The snot-nosed Kid is next in line, frozen by fear. Marcus pulls on his hand. 
MARCUS It's okay. C'mon. 
The Kid stays put. 
MARCUS What's your name? 
The Kid shakes his head meekly. 
MARCUS ...You can tell me... 
No response. 
MARCUS ...How about Santa? If you don't tell him, you won't get a present. 
This penetrates the Kid's fear. He moves. 
MARCUS ...That's right. Let's tell Santa. 
Marcus leads the Kid up to the throne and places him on Willie's lap. 
WILLIE What do you want? C'mon, wuddya want? A snot rag? 
The Kid just stares, motionless except for the flowing rivulet of snot. Willie can't help but stare at it. 
WILLIE (to himself) ...Another fuckin' mongoloid. (shouts) Marcus I get him outta here before he pisses on me. 
Suddenly the Kid is moved to yank Willie's beard. He holds it stretched below Willie's chin. 
WILLIE (whispered to the kid) ...Let it go, you little bastard. 
KID It's not real. 
WILLIE It was real. The hair fell out when I got sick. 
KID How'd you get sick? 
WILLIE I loved a woman who wasn't clean. 
KID Mrs. Santa? 
WILLIE No, her sister. (whispers through clenched teeth) Let the fucking thing go. 
KID What's it like at the North Pole? 
WILLIE Like the suburbs. 
KID Which one? 
WILLIE Apache Junction. What the fuck do you care? 
Willie shoves the Kid: 
WILLIE Get the hell off my lap. 
The Kid backs away, looking at him. 
KID You are really Santa, right? 
WILLIE No. No, I'm an accountant. I wear this as a fucking fashion thing. 
KID Okay. 
The Kid backs away in awe, never breaking his reverent stare. 
KID Uh-huh. 
WILLIE And you're right there to grab his fuckin' balls. 
KID Uh-huh. 
WILLIE Right height. 
KID Yeah. 
Willie demonstrates with a sharp turn of his hand: 
WILLIE Twist 'em. 
KID Why do you need a car? 
WILLIE ...Fuck you talkin' about? 
KID This car. 
WILLIE Whuh. Which turn is it? 
KID Sage Terrace. Where's your sleigh? 
Willie answers absently, his head slightly ducked and his eyes darting side to side, checking for road signs: 
WILLIE Repairs. In the shop. 
KID Where're the reindeer? 
WILLIE I stable 'em. Is it gonna be left or right? 
KID (pointing left) That way. Where's the stable? 
WILLIE Next to the shop. 
KID How do they sleep? 
WILLIE Who -- the reindeer? Standing up. 
KID But the noise, how do they sleep? 
WILLIE What noise? 
KID From the shop. 
WILLIE They, uh, they only work during the day. 
KID I thought it was always night at the North Pole. 
WILLIE Not now. Now it's always day. 
KID Then how do they sleep? 
WILLIE Well, they -- WILL YOU PUH-LEEEZ SHUT THE FUCK UP! HOW THE FUCK DO KNOW?! I'M GONNA -- Whoa! Sage Terrace! 
He makes a hard left. 
WILLIE ...What is it with you? Somebody drop you on your fucking head? 
KID On my head? 
WILLIE What, are they gonna drop you on somebody else's head? 
KID How can they drop me onto my own head? 
WILLIE Not onto your own h -- ARE YOU FUCKING WITH ME? 
EXT. THE KID'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
He puts the folio back, grabs the cash. 
KID You need money to fix your sleigh? 
WILLIE Huh? Yeah, whateverthefuck... 
KID You want milk and cookies? 
Willie bends down and faces the Kid with a smile. 
WILLIE Daddy got a car? 
EXT. THE KID'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
At the cut a new Mercedes screeches through the frame and, as we hear it recede, we are left looking at the kid, who stands at the curb, waving happily. 
KID Bye Santa! 
INT. CHAMBERLAIN'S - SECURITY OFFICE - NIGHT 
CLOSE-UP: the glowing ash of a cigarette burning down. The inhale lasts as long as comic timing will allow -- about six or seven seconds. 
ANGLE ON: 
A wiry, hard-bitten, sun-baked saddlebag of a man, GIN SLAGEL sits behind his cluttered desk sucking on a filterless Pall Mall. We can hear his in-taken breath rattling over and around the phlegm, growths, and polyps that line his embattled trachea. His words come out on an exhaled cloud chamber's worth of smoke: 
GIN "Fuck stick"? 
Bob Chipeska sits opposite. 
CHIPESKA Yes, I thought it was strange too, but you know, I, I, I, I, uh, I, his little friend promised he wouldn't say it in front of the children. Which is fine because, you know, urn, there's an adult world and a child's world and that's okay. I'm not a censor. 
GIN Little friend? 
CHIPESKA Yes, a, a, a dwarf. Or midget... a, a, I don't know what he's called exactly but... a little guy. Little. Billy Barty. God rest. But thin fingers. Not the fat sausage fingers. 
GIN "Little people," that's what they like. 
CHIPESKA Ah, yes, right. 
GIN So "fuck stick," that's all? 
CHIPESKA Well, no, there was something else... 
INT. CHAMBERLAIN'S - WOMEN'S BIG AND TALL - (EARLIER) 
Chipeska walks by a cashier station carrying some paperwork he's absorbed in, but hears some FAINT GROANS that make him pause. Curious, he heads in the direction of the sounds. 
They're coming from the dressing room area. 
Chipeska curiously makes his way towards a corridor of dressing rooms. 
CHIPESKA (V.O.) ...A couple of days ago I was in Women's Big & Tall? -- 
A sign reads: "Three Times A Lady". 
INT. CHAMBERLAIN'S - DRESSING ROOM AREA - (EARLIER) 
He goes down a corridor of dressing rooms. 
CHIPESKA (V.O.) and I heard these, urn, you know, these... noises. 
The sound of throttling lust builds in volume. He follows his ears until he arrives at a dressing room door. A Big or Tall woman within screams with pleasure: 
FEMALE VOICE (O.S.) Oh yeah! Oh yeah! 
WILLIE'S VOICE (O.S.) Yeah! Yeah! You ain't gonna shit right for a week! 
He looks underneath and spots black Santa boots with red velvet pants around the ankles. 
Willie opens the door and an avalanche of beer bottle empties tumbles out, rolling everywhere. 
MARCUS You cocksucker! 
Willie starts the engine and pulls out, and Marcus yells to the receding car: 
MARCUS ...EVER HEAR OF THE OPEN-BOTTLE LAW?! (then, to himself) -- You dumb Dipshit Motherfucker! 
EXT. RESIDENCE MOTEL - NIGHT 
Willie parks the Mercedes in the front of a rundown motel complex. He walks past hookers and junkies until he gets to his unit. 
He pulls out his key and just as he's about to insert it in the lock he sees a flashlight beam shining inside the window. 
Surprised, he backs off cautiously and presses up against the wall. 
Someone inside is rifling the room. 
Willie hisses at a nearby hooker: 
WILLIE Opal, come here. 
Opal looks at him with disdain. 
OPAL Screw you, Willie -- last time I didn't shit right for a week. 
WILLIE No, not that -- come here! 
Reluctantly, she sidles over. 
WILLIE Who the fuck's in my room, did you see someone go into my fuckin' room? 
OPAL Yeah some guy askin' 'boutcha -- looked like a cop. 
WILLIE Ah fuck. 
INT. MARCUS' APARTMENT - NIGHT 
Marcus is on the phone with Willie. 
MARCUS What guy?! You get a look at him? 
INTERCUT: 
EXT. RESIDENCE MOTEL - NIGHT 
Willie is at a pay phone. 
WILLIE No, I think it's a cop though. You think someone's onto us? 
MARCUS Is there anything in the room? Anything professional? 
WILLIE No. Clothes. 
MARCUS Just ditch. You got anywhere to sack out for a while? 
INT. THE KID'S HOUSE - FOYER - NIGHT 
The Kid swings the door open to Willie, who stands on the stoop holding a small grip. 
KID Santa! 
WILLIE Yeah. 
KID You're bringing my present early? 
WILLIE NO. 
KID But I never told you what I wanted. 
WILLIE No. 
KID Warm milk? 
WILLIE No. 
Willie carefully, carefully puts glass and bottle down on the nightstand and slowly raises both hands in a "Don't... Move" gesture to keep them from flying off. 
KID Should I fix you some sandwiches? 
WILLIE What is with the fixing sandwiches? No. 
Satisfied that the bottle and glass are not going anywhere, Willie climbs unsteadily onto the bed and stares at the ceiling. 
KID Okay. You want anything else? 
WILLIE No. As soon as the bed stops moving I'm going to sleep... 
KID Okay. 
WILLIE ...Wake me up... when the little hand is on the... 
A long beat. 
The ragged breath of drunken sleep. 
KID Okay. 
INT. CHAMBERLAIN'S - MAIN FLOOR - SCARF AREA - DAY 
Marcus's wife Lois stands in front of a mirror, trying on a cashmere scarf. Her look of pruney disapproval is in place, as ever. She takes off the scarf and writes something in a small spiral notebook... 
SALESWOMAN Can I help you, ma'am? 
LOIS Just looking. 
Across the store, she spies the jewelry counter. 
INT. CHAMBERLAIN'S - MAIN FLOOR - JEWELRY AREA - DAY 
Lois stands looking intently down through the glass case in pruney disapproval. 
SALESMAN Help you with anything, ma'am? 
Without bothering to look up: 
LOIS Just looking. 
As he drifts away she takes out her spiral notebook and makes more notes. 
INT. SAGUARO SQUARE MALL - FOOD COURT - NIGHT 
Willie and Marcus nosh on food-court Gyros. 
WILLIE Fuck me? Fuck you! 
MARCUS You can't just take up with some kid! You don't know who's around, what they do! 
WILLIE You got some nerve you little shit ya. You my mom now?! You shat me out your -- 
MARCUS You said that last night you stupid fuck! 
WILLIE Ah, shit! Fuck you! 
Lois appears with a salad on a tray and a look of pruney disapproval. She sits next to Marcus and, in the way of old couples comfortable with each other, he rests a hand on her knee and continues to talk, ignoring her, while she picks through her salad, ignoring him. 
MARCUS You are by far the dumbest most pathetic piece of maggot-eaten shit that has ever slid from God's gilded ass! What if the kid has one of those fucking play-dates they have now? 
WILLIE You shittin' me?! He doesn't have fucking friends! Not even an imaginary one! Unless he got ditched by him! He's just a fuckin' misfit! Lives with his grandma who sits drooling in front of the TV! Every once in a while she gets up to play soccer with her tits! What, she's gon' rat me out? She don't know her ass from last Tuesday! 
MARCUS Morning Jesse. 
JESSE (to Willie) Ho! Ho! Ho! 
Willie pants under the weight of his bag: 
WILLIE Up your ass. 
EXT. SAGUARO SQUARE MALL - PARKING LOT - MORNING 
As Willie and Marcus enter the store Gin Slagel drives by their cars, carefully noting their tags. 
INT. CHAMBERLAIN'S - WINTER WONDERLAND - DAY 
Willie drops the bag with a loud thud. 
WILLIE GOD dammit! 
MARCUS You tear your ball again? 
WILLIE No, it's okay. 
Together they unload the extremely heavy gifts. 
MARCUS Let's do the other thing. 
Willie follows Marcus behind the Wonderland backdrop. Marcus points to an air duct in the ceiling. 
MARCUS There. 
Willie crouches and Marcus climbs on his shoulders. 
INT. CHAMBERLAIN'S - AIR DUCT - DAY 
The duct pops open and Marcus climbs in, shimmying down to a junction and continuing on. 
INT. CHAMBERLAIN'S - CUSTOMER SERVICE OFFICES - DAY 
A long row of cubicles, each one occupied with Customer Service Operators. As they work, the loud squeaks and popping metal sounds of a dwarf crawling through a duct are heard above them. 
Each operator in succession notes the racket, looking up curiously as the sounds pass overhead. 
Suddenly, the sounds stop. Everyone returns to work. 
Then... 
SQUEAK! POP! SQUEAK! The sounds resume. The operators look up again as the noises fade away. 
INT. CHAMBERLAIN'S - SURVEILLANCE ROOM - DAY 
The sounds continue until Marcus' face appears at the ceiling duct of an unmanned surveillance room. 
He focuses on the wall of a hundred identical VCRs and squints to see the brand name: SONY HVR-3200. 
EXT. ELECTRONICS STORE - DAY 
Lois exits an electronics store with a box slung under her arm, her mouth turned down in pruney disapproval. She places the box on the hood of her car and we see its printings SONY HVR-3200. 
She opens the box, fishes out the remote, then tosses the box and VCR into a nearby trash can. 
EXT. ARIZONA STATE PRISON - DAY 
Gin Slagel walks through the main gate of the heavily fortified penitentiary, leaving a huge trail of cigarette smoke. 
INT. PRISON - WAITING ROOM - DAY 
Gin Slagel sits, smoking and waiting with family members and lawyers. A guard enters and motions. 
GUARD Alright Gin, come on. 
Gin turns one palm up. 
GIN Fucks large women. What can I say. 
EXT. SAGUARO SQUARE MALL - PARKING LOT - DAY 
A bus clears frame, revealing the kid as he walks toward the mall. 
VOICES Loser! Dipshit! 
CLANG! The kid is hit in the head with a can again. Again, no reaction. 
Someone in the group of frustrated bullies has a fresh idea: 
VOICE Wedgie! 
Cheering, the six bullies engulf the kid. 
INT. CHAMBERLAIN'S - WINTER WONDERLAND - DAY 
Marcus and Willie go about the business of being a Santa-Elf team. Willie sees off another child, 
CHILD Pokemon. 
WILLIE Done. 
MARCUS Next! 
Marcus heads to the velvet rope to find the Kid, mussed up and dirty, the band of his underwear around his chest. 
KID Santa here? 
MARCUS Oh jeez. 
Marcus unclips the rope and the Kid approaches Willie. 
WILLIE Is that your underwear? 
KID Part of it. 
WILLIE Where's the rest? Never mind. What do you want? 
KID I was thinking I wanted a purple stuffed elephant, not pink, but now I changed my mind. 
WILLIE What. 
KID Now I don't want an elephant at all. I want a gorilla named Davy for beating up the skateboard kids who pull on my underwear and he could take his orders from the talking walnut so it wouldn't be my bad thing. 
Willie stares at him. 
WILLIE ...You know when I was your age, I didn't need no fuckin' gorilla, and I wasn't any bigger than you. One day I came crying home to Dad because four kids had beat me up, and you know what he did?' 
KID He make it all better? 
WILLIE No. He kicked my ass. You know why? 
KID You went bathroom on Mommy's dishes? 
WILLIE What the fuck? No. 
KID He try to teach you not to cry and be a man. 
WILLIE Nope, it was because he was a mean, drunk son of a bitch. When he wasn't busy busting my ass, he was puttin' out cigarettes on my neck. 
KID Uh-huh... 
WILLIE The world's fuckin' unfair -- it don't give ya nothing. You can wish all you want but you gotta take what you need. Stand up for yourself... stop being such a pussy and kick those kids in the balls or something. (pause) Or don't, I don't give a shit. Just leave me the hell out of it. 
KID 'Kay. Thanks, Santa. 
MARCUS Thirty-five. 
GIN Half. 
MARCUS Forty. 
GIN Half. 
MARCUS Forty-two? 
GIN Half. 
MARCUS Forty-two five. 
GIN Half. 
MARCUS Fooooooorty... eight. 
GIN Half. 
MARCUS Forty-nine? 
GIN Half. 
MARCUS Well... 
Marcus sighs. 
MARCUS ...what's one point. 
GIN Down the middle on the dough, and any merchandise you take I look over and cherry-pick. 
MARCUS No! Money's one thing, but -- 
GIN It ain't Chinese menu, jagoff. I tell yea how the way it's gonna be. This is pricks ficks. 
Gin leaves. Marcus and Willie stare at his retreating back as they talk: 
WILLIE ...Pricks ficks? 
MARCUS Ah, he's a fuckin' moron. 
WILLIE Yeah, well I guess that's how you got the upper hand. 
MARCUS Fuck you. 
WILLIE Negotiating. 
MARCUS Fuck you -- you don't like it, next year, fuck off. I can always get another box jockey. 
WILLIE Yeah, and I can get another midget. 
Marcus turns to Willie: 
MARCUS Yeah? Where? You see us hangin' off of fuckin' trees? Like fuckin' crab apples? And even if we did, you'd never front your own racket. 'Cause you got no discipline and zero fuckin' initiative. You'd fall apart without me. You're just too fuckin' pathetic -- 
WILLIE Yeah, yeah. 
MARCUS -- too fuckin' pathetic for words, you fuckin' loser. And you fuckin' know it. 
INT. THE KID'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
Willie drags his ass through the front door, dejected. 
GRANDMA Roger! You're home. Let me fix you some sandwiches. 
He stares at her. His gaze is far away. Finally, he seems to rouse himself: 
WILLIE Ah, fuck it. 
Willie, dreamy, refuses to take the bait: 
WILLIE No no. No; I beat the crap out of some kids today -- but, you know, for a purpose. It really made me feel pretty good about myself -- like I did something constructive for a change. Accomplished somethin'. 
Marcus stares at him. 
MARCUS ...You need many years of therapy. Many, many, many, many, many... many fucking years of therapy. 
INT. CHAMBERLAIN'S - MAIN FLOOR - FURS - DAY 
Lois, her face set in pruney disapproval, flips slowly through a rack of furs. 
A salesman approaches from behind her. She somehow senses his presence; without bothering to look around she murmurs: 
LOIS Just looking... 
INT. THE KID'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
Willie and Sue come in, carrying a few bottles of liquor. 
Willie closes the door, and freezes, realizing that something is wrong. 
WILLIE ...Hello? 
Nothing. 
WILLIE ...Granma? 
He hears the TV and heads for the living room. Sue follows a few steps behind. 
Willie finds Grandma in her chair, not moving. 
WILLIE Granma... 
He strains through the dim light for any evidence of life. 
WILLIE ...Oh jeez. 
He lets out a sigh and leans in close to listen to her heart. 
SUE Oh my God... 
GRANDMA Roger! 
Willie jumps and screams like a girl. 
GRANDMA ...You're home. Let me fix you some sandwiches. 
She gets up and heads for the kitchen as Willie tries to compose himself. 
WILLIE (holding his chest) No thanks. 
INT. THE KID'S HOUSE - KID'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
The Kid sleeps. He is awakened by the sounds of stumbling and CLANKING BOTTLES. He hears GIGGLING, more STUMBLING. He gets up. 
INT. THE'KID'S HOUSE - HALLWAY - NIGHT 
The Kid discovers some clothes. Then some more. He follows the trail of clothes towards the sounds coming from the Master Bedroom. 
INT. THE KID'S HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Facing the CAMERA, Willie's in his underpants and Santa hat lying on the floor on top of Sue. He's gripping her panties with his teeth -- stretching the elastic while he starts pulling them down. Sue's giggling. 
The bedroom door opens behind them and the Kid walks in. He comes up and stands over them, a few steps behind Willie. 
Willie freezes, panty elastic waistband still stretched out in his teeth. He senses something, and his eyes look up from under his Santa hat, his wolfish smile fades. 
The Kid stands there, hands behind his back. 
The Kid comes up behind him clutching a document. 
KID SANTA! 
Willie jumps with a start. 
KID You wanna see my report card? 
Willie takes the report card as he tries to compose himself. 
He looks at it. All C's and one B. 
KID Think I did good? 
Willie's eyes drift back to the card and settle on COMMENTS. 
They read, "Thurman has an active, inquiring mind. And no friends." 
WILLIE Who the fuck is Thurman? This is you? Your name's Thurman? 
KID Yeah. 
WILLIE (incredulous) Thurman Merman?! 
KID Yeah. 
WILLIE Jesus. 
KID (back to the report card) You think I did good? 
Willie does not want to engage. 
WILLIE Whaddya you care what I think, anyway? (pause, relenting a bit) What do I fuckin' know? Better than I ever did. I never got any B's, 
KID I thought maybe since at least I did good in school, you'll bring me a present this year. 'Cause last Christmas and the one before that you didn't bring no presents... 
This is a lot for Willie to hear. 
WILLIE Oh... 
KID ...Even though I'm a dipshit loser. 
WILLIE (a beat, then explodes) Jesus Fucking Christ, Kid! Why do talk about yourself like that? What the fuck is that about?! What's with you anyway? I ain't Fucking Santa Claus! Look at me, I am living fucking proof that there ain't no Santa Claus! 
Pause. 
KID I know there's no Santa. I just thought maybe you'd wanna give me a present 'cause we're friends. 
WILLIE Oh... 
An uncomfortable silence. Willie is most uncomfortable. 
WILLIE (pause, then sincerely to the kid) Look, kicking the shit out of those kids, that's as generous as I can get. 
The Kid just nods and doesn't say anything. Willie can't take it. 
WILLIE JESUS FUCKING CHRIST, I GOTTA GO TO WORK! 
Willie runs out of the room very upset, 
INT. THE KID'S HOUSE - FOYER - MORNING 
Willie grabs a bottle of whiskey off the counter and hurries out, slamming the door. 
INT. CHAMBERLAIN'S - WINTER WONDERLAND - DAY 
Marcus checks his watch impatiently as the endless line of excited children and their parents impatiently murmurs. 
The tension is suffocating Marcus. Finally, a gasp goes up from the crowd. 
We see Gin exit the store and head for his car. 
MARCUS There he is... that lousy, leatherfaced, dago motherfucker... 
EXT. QUIET ROAD - NIGHT 
Marcus stands by the side of his van. It's parked on the shoulder with the hood up, jumper cables attached and hanging. Lois is in the driver's seat. 
Gin's Ford 4 X 4 speeds around the corner and Marcus flags him down. 
SCREEEEECH! Gin slams on the brakes, then backs up and pulls over. He emerges from the 4 X 4 with road rage on full brew, and strides over to the van. 
GIN Jesus, Mother Mary and Joseph! What in the name of the holy lord Fuck is the problem now? 
MARCUS Sorry, the van stalled. Give us a jump will ya? 
GIN Well, I'll be dipped in dogshit!... What am I, your auto mechanic now? 
He shakes his head in disgust. Grumbling, he goes back to the 4 X 4 and drives it into position. He gets out and raises the hood. 
The two vehicles face each other nose-to-nose, several feet apart as Gin opens the hood. 
GIN (motions to his battery) Help yourself, small fry. 
Marcus seems to have a little difficulty reaching the battery terminals. 
MARCUS It's hard for me to reach... 
Gin grabs the cables from him. Marcus takes a few steps back. 
GIN Jesus Christ, give me those! 
MARCUS Thanks. 
Gin attaches the cables. 
GIN (then, to Lois) Alright, TRY IT! 
Lois turns the key and the van starts right up. Gin takes the cables off the van and closes the hood. He lights up a Pall Mall. 
Marcus signals to Lois. She puts the car into gear and stomps her foot on the accelerator, squashing Gin between the two vehicles. 
ANGLE PROM INSIDE VAN (SLOW MOTION): 
Gin's face as it's squooshed up against the van's windshield. 
A cloud of cigarette smoke escapes his lips. 
Lois continues to step on the gas, trying to crush him. 
ANGLE ON: the tires spinning in the gravel. 
Finally, she takes her foot off the gas. The van eases back. 
Gin falls to the ground with a groan. Marcus steps up and leans over him. 
MARCUS Oh my, what a terrible accident! 
LOIS Is he dead? 
MARCUS No, but it looks like you broke most of his ribs. 
Then, leaning down to Gin. 
MARCUS (for Gin's benefit) I'd say maybe... fifty percent of them? Or do you think thirty percent? 
LOIS I needed more of a running start -- I couldn't build up any speed. 
Marcus paces around trying to figure out what to do next. 
Marcus moves the backdrop to reveal the air vent. 
MARCUS Let's go. 
Willie cracks open an ampule of Amyl Nitrate and inhales deeply. Marcus grimaces: 
MARCUS ...Oh Christ. 
WILLIE (red-faced, holding breath) Let's do it. 
INT. CHAMBERLAIN'S - MAIN FLOOR - NIGHT 
With the sound of closing circuits, banks of light systematically shut down in the various departments of the now empty.store. 
INT. CHAMBERLAIN'S - ENTRANCE - NIGHT 
Exhausted employees file out of the store past Jesse. 
Eventually Willie emerges. 
JESSE Merry Christmas, Willie. 
WILLIE Up your ass. 
Jesse heads for the alarm panel near the doorway and punches the key labeled ARM. An LED readout labeled ARMING counts down from 30 seconds. 
Jesse exits the store, locking the door and heading home. 
INT. CHAMBERLAIN'S - CUSTOMER SERVICE OFFICES - NIGHT 
The cubicles are now empty and the office is still, but we hear dwarf-shimmy in the ducts overhead. 
INT. CHAMBERLAIN'S ENTRANCE - NIGHT 
By the front door, the alarm continues to count down -- 25... 
INT. CHAMBERLAIN'S - AIR DUCT - NIGHT 
Marcus arrives at the vent above the surveillance room. He reaches in his pocket, pulls out the remote control Lois bought, and aims it down into the room. 
INT. CHAMBERLAN'S - SURVEILLANCE ROOM - NIGHT 
The huge bank of VCRs powers down. 
INT. CHAMBERLAIN'S ENTRANCE - NIGHT 
ALARM BOX 
INT. CHAMBERLAIN'S - AIR DUCT - NIGHT 
Marcus arrives at the precipice of a descending duct. He snaps on a biking helmet and takes a deep breath. 
MARCUS All right... 
He dives down the duct. 
INT. CHAMBERLAIN'S - AIR DUCTS - NIGHT 
We PAN and WHIP-PIVOT along the outside of several lengths of ductwork, following the muffled SCREAM of a thousand girlies echoing inside. 
The ductwork dimples out along the bottom with the WUBBA sound of flopping aluminum as Marcus's weight travels its length; at turns, Marcus's inertial force makes one side of the duct momentarily dent out. 
We thus follow Marcus's progress as he slides, bumps, ricochets and barrels through the department store. 
INT. CHAMBERLAIN'S - MAIN FLOOR - ENTRANCE - NIGHT 
As the alarm continues to count down, 12... 11... a distant 
scream grows louder until -- 
Marcus starts in Ladies' Accessories, finding the cashmere scarf. 
Willie applies the drill to the safe. 
Marcus makes his way through Lingerie. 
Willie pulls back the drill. The bit is trashed, the safe is completely unscathed. 
Marcus is in Shoes picking out pumps for Lois. 
Willie is in Home Improvement, flipping tools off the shelves into a cart of his own. 
Marcus is in Evening Wear, jumping to try to pull a stole off a mannequin. 
Willie batters a chisel into the seam of the safe door. 
Marcus continues to leap at the mannequin. 
Willie is atop the safe, swinging a sledgehammer at the lock. 
Marcus swings at the mannequin's knees with a golf club. 
Willie uses a plasma welder on the safe. 
Marcus, having chopped down the mannequin, drags off its stole. 
Willie is back over the safe, battering it with the sledgehammer, roaring with each swing. 
Marcus is in Housewares pilfering crock pots. 
Willie, sweating, drops the sledgehammer clanking to the floor. Wiping his forehead, he circles the safe. When he gets to the back of the safe he stops, thinks. 
Marcus is in Home Entertainment grabbing a stereo. 
Willie is hunched at the back of the safe, stethoscope to its surface, giving exploratory taps with two knuckles. 
Sound perspective through the stethoscope: hollow THUNKS followed by an unnaturally loud and present CREEEEEEEEAK. 
Willie reacts quizzically. After a considering moment he rises. we can see, on the far side of the safe, its door as it finishes creaking open. 
Marcus enters the room. Willie looks at him. 
WILLIE Piece of cake. 
Marcus starts removing stacks of cash and loading them into the Santa sack. Willie wipes sweat off his forehead. 
WILLIE ...I'll be right back. I gotta grab one thing. 
INT. CHAMBERLAN'S - TOY DEPT. - NIGHT 
We are looking at a big, fuzzy, smiling, pink stuffed elephant. 
Willie's hand hesitates between this elephant and the one behind, which is purple. We hear him muttering: 
WILLIE Shit... which did he say? 
The hand finally leaves with the purple elephant. 
We hold for a long beat. 
The hand reenters to put back the purple and take the pink. 
Willie turns around holding the stuffed elephant. 
Marcus and Lois are standing there presenting a grotesque picture: Lois has a shopping cart filled with shoes, scarves, jewels, a salad spinner, purses, a block of Ginsu knives, an abdomen exerciser. She wears a pair of sunglasses from which a price tag dangles, and a long ermine stole. 
Next to her Marcus holds the Santa bag bulging with -- indeed, sprouting -- cash. 
WILLIE Well, I don't think that store dick is gonna want this. 
Police everywhere. 
MEGAPHONE VOICE And you, Santa! -- drop the elephant! 
Willie stares. Marcus looks wildly around. 
MARCUS ...Where did you come from? 
CHIEF Tipped off. 
WILLIE Shit! 
CAMERA TRACKS IN ON HIS FACE 
Willie slaps his forehead. 
WILLIE ...Fuckin' kid! 
CHIEF All three of you are in so much shit it's almost unbelievable. 
LOIS Gevalt. 
MARCUS Oh yeah? Well come'n get us, coppers! Ha-ha-ha-ha! 
BANG! BANG! BANG! 
His .45 roars. 
The cops return fire. 
WILLIE Fuck me... 
He ducks, clutching the elephant to his chest, and scurries behind a counter. 
WILLIE ...fuck me fuck me fuck me... 
Gunfire fills the air. 
Exploding merchandise chases along the counter behind Willie as the cops seek to put him down. 
Under the gunfire we hear Marcus's maniacal laughter. 
Willie reaches the end of the counter. A brief open space separates him from a stairwell; he dashes across as gunfire redoubles and plunges down the stairs. 
EXT. CHAMBERLAIN'S - LOADING DOCK - NIGHT 
Willie bursts out onto the loading dock still holding the elephant. He dives into his Mercedes and peels out. 
EXT. SAGUARO SQUARE MALL - PARKING LOT - NIGHT 
Rounding the corner of the loading dock, Willie comes upon a fleet of squad cars idling in the street. Cops yell, draw their guns and fire as Willie clips a couple cars, skids and slues, and finally is clear of the pack. 
He roars up the road as policemen leap for their vehicles, crank up their sirens and pursue. 
INT. MERCEDES - MOVING - NIGHT 
Willie drives, his jaw set, a desperate man in a Santa suit. 
He glances up at the rearview which shows many flashing light bars. 
WILLIE ...It's Christmas... and the fucking kid is getting his present. 
EXT. THE KID'S HOUSE - NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT 
Willie's car corners onto Sage Terrace on two wheels, slams back down onto four, fishtails up to the kid's house and squeals braking into its driveway. 
The police vehicles, in hot pursuit, squeal, skid, and slew around in a jumble at the foot of the lawn. Cops leap out of their cars just as Willie jumps from his. 
MEGAPHONE VOICE Halt, put your hands up!
