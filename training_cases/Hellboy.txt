INT. DARKROOM - INTERVIEW 1 
In a photographic DARKROOM: old optical enlargers, porcelain trays, timers, and stills hanging out to dry. 
GEORGE MATLIN, a slightly obese, nearsighted man in his seventies. 
OLD MATLIN Is he real? Oh yeah -- Absolutely. 
Super: CPL. GEORGE MATLIN, combat photographer. 
OLD MATLIN I haven't talked about it for years, you know? (looks at the camera) Everyone called me crazy... 
Matlin smiles as he paws through a box of old negatives. 
OLD MATLIN But I have the negative. 
Someone turns on the darkroom's red safety light for an eerie, dramatic effect. 
TECHNICIAN'S VOICE Get ready, 3-2-1... Roll tape. 
OLD MATLIN It all started back in ´44. I was a Corps photographer aboard an allied submarine... 
CUT TO: 
INT. SUBMARINE HALLWAY - NIGHT 
YOUNG MATLIN's hands again paw through a bunch of negatives, again under a red light. Now, at 21, he's wedged in a submarine corridor, a crowded maze of pipes and gauges. 
35mm still cameras dangle from his neck. He shrinks back as a squad of MARINES hustles past him, loading weapons. 
OLD MATLIN'S VOICE ...off the coast of Scotland. Classified mission. I was 21... 
SGT. WHITMAN, 44, tough as nails, pushes through, his uniform soaked in sweat. 
OLD MATLIN'S VOICE We had an English civilian on board. Not much older than me but already an advisor to President Roosevelt. "Paranormal" advisor, I kid you not -- 
Whitman continues down the passageway until he reaches a small... 
INT. SUBMARINE STATEROOM - NIGHT 
Within, an incongruously proper young Englishman "reading" an ancient set of Tarot cards. 
OLD MATLIN'S VOICE His name was Trevor. Profesor Trevor -- 
WHITMAN -- Broom! Topside, now. 
TREVOR "BROOM" BRUTTENHOLM is a gaunt, olive-skinned man in his late twenties. In his hands, a tarot deck. He turns the cards face up: THE FOOL, THE MOON... 
WHITMAN The sooner we're done, the better. 
Broom grabs a worn-down wooden box full of books and amulets. It has a leather strap that allows him to carry it, much like a carpenter's tool box. 
BROOM This is an important mission, Sgt. Whitman. I hope you realize that. 
WHITMAN Oh -- you don't wanna know what I think. Topside, now. 
He moves away. Broom takes a small box and a few amulets. 
Before exiting, he pauses and tensely turns the last TAROT CARD: THE DEVIL. 
CUT TO: 
OMIT 
INT/EXT. SCOTLAND - TUNNEL - NIGHT 
Super: OCTOBER 9, 1944, SCOTLAND. 
It's raining like hell now. Soldiers move through a short tunnel carved into the mountain. 
Whitman signals his men to spread out, then comes alongside Broom. 
BROOM Sgt. Whitman!! Sgt. Whitman!! May I have a word?? 
WHITMAN (impatient) What is it? 
BROOM In private, if you don't mind... 
EXT. SCOTLAND CHAPEL REMAINS 
GRIGORY This will guide you back to me. 
He pulls her close, the clouds of their breath mingling. 
GRIGORY I grant you everlasting life, youth and the power to serve me. 
He dips his fingers in a wooden bowl full of blood, then wipes her tears away with a crimson thumb, both a consolation and a ritual. 
VON KRUPT, an acrid German General, wearing dark SCARLET glasses and LEATHER GLOVES, appears. Looks at his pocket watch. On the gold lid: a SWASTIKA. 
VON KRUPT It's time. 
OMIT 
EXT. ABBEY RUINS - ALTAR AREA - CEREMONY - NIGHT 
Grigory walks towards the machine, its colossal steel and copper clockworks gleaming in the floodlights. 
VON KRUPT Five years of research and construction, Grigory. Five years!! 
He strides alongside Grigory and Ilsa, who holds an umbrella to shield her master from the pouring rain. 
VON KRUPT The furhrer doesn't look kindly on failure. 
GRIGORY There will be no failure, General. I promised Herr Hitler a miracle. I'll deliver one. 
Kroenen mutters excitedly as he opens a polished oak box containing a massive gold and copper MECHA-GLOVE. 
Grigory extends his hand so that KROENEN may fit him with the contraption, which is attached to cables and hoses. 
EXT. THE HILLTOP - ALLIED SOLDIERS - NIGHT 
The Americans fan out, unseen. 
Broom and Whitman dive into a ditch barely in time to avoid a German foot patrol. 
Other GI's take up positions below a machine gun nest. 
EXT. ABBEY RUINS - ALTAR AREA - NIGHT 
Grigory walks to the top of the altar, cables trailing behind him. 
GRIGORI Tonight, We will open a portal and awaken the OGDRU JAHAD: The seven Gods of chaos. (beat) Our enemies will be destroyed. In an instant, all impurity in this world will be razed and from the ashes a new eden will arise. 
He looks down at the machine and whispers -- 
GRIGORY Ragnarok, Anung Ia Anung. 
He flexes his fingers and in response -- 
-- the two metal rings swing around the machine's central axis. TCHINK!!! WHIRRR!!! STEAM escapes from the ducts and pipes. An invisible blast of energy forces the falling rain to swerve momentarily away from Grigory's body. 
Ilsa signals TWO NAZI SCIENTISTS standing at a control panel. 
ILSA More Power!! Don't let the level drop!! 
One of them inserts a 20 inch SOLID GOLD CYLINDER into the machine. Two openings remain vacant next to it. 
A blade of light opens in the air! 
Burning symbols slash the air, like living serpents of fire. 
EXT. COSMIC SLIT - NIGHT 
The edges of the cosmic slit sizzle with color; an ALIEN GALAXY sparkles on the other side. Suddenly, a work light tears loose and flies in. 
EXT. COSMIC SLIT - FROM THE OTHER SIDE - NIGHT 
The six-foot work light tumbles by the massive OGDRU JAHAD: seven egg-like monoliths of unholy origin. 
Within their translucent walls, horrible creatures lie slumbering. As the light sweeps by, one of the giants opens a filmy eye, and then another, and another, and another... 
Fleshy tentacles move lazily within their crystalline prison. 
EXT. ABBEY RUINS - ALTAR AREA - NIGHT 
Grigory screams as his body rises. Veins swell in his neck, his face distorted by ecstasy and pain. 
CLICK. Someone shoots a photograph. 
EXT. RUINS - IN THE UNDERBRUSH - NIGHT 
It's Matlin, snapping for all he's worth. Whitman pulls him down and pulls out a large bayonet blade. 
WHITMAN Listen to me, you moron: you do that again, I'll carve you a new -- 
Too late. One of the NAZI SCIENTIST has heard them. 
EXT. RUINS, IN THE UNDERBRUSH - NIGHT 
WHITMAN What are you two talking about?? 
MATLIN A red ape. 
BROOM It's-not-an-ape -- 
They hear the labored breathing of a living creature. 
MATLIN It's got a big stone -- in its hand -- 
BROOM I think that is its hand. 
Hissing, the thing cowers between a gargoyle and a stone saint. 
WHITMAN points his gun at the scarlet shape above. Broom stops him from firing. 
BROOM Wait -- 
In deep shadow, the RED THING observes with bright, golden eyes veined with streaks of burnt sienna. 
Broom slowly fishes a BABY RUTH candy bar from his pocket. Peeling back the wrapper, he slowly waves the candy. The RED THING shrinks back. 
Broom bites into the candy and chews, noisily smacking his lips. Offers the candy again. This time, out of the dark comes a small FACE, not very different from the stone demons around it. 
The creature extends its right arm: it's solid stone with tiny runes engraved around the thick, cylindrical wrist. Four articulated stone fingers wiggle, reaching for the chocolate. 
YOUNG SOLDIER Jesus! would'ya look at the size of that whammer! 
Whitman moves closer. On the wall behind him, a shadow shows the RED THING climbing into Broom's arms. 
Broom tenderly covers it with a blanket. The stubby fingers snatch the candy. Broom smiles. 
BROOM It's a boy. Just a baby boy. 
EXT. CHAPEL RUINS - NIGHT 
The soldiers cluster around, curious to see it. Matlin prepares his camera and directs them into a group shot. Broom smiles like a proud new father and embraces the creature, patting him gently. CLICK!!! 
OLD MATLIN'S VOICE Best photo of my career -- 
CUT TO: 
INT. DARKROOM - BACK TO INTERVIEW 1 
OLD MATLIN and no one has ever seen it. They keep saying he's not real, but I want to set the record straight before I go. 
Matlin finally pulls an old 8x10 from a battered portfolio. He smiles, full of memories. 
OLD MATLIN Here. The real picture, not the retouched one in LIFE magazine. (hands over the photograph) This is him. The very same night we found him. The night Broom gave him that name. (beat) Can I say it on TV? He called him -- 
EXT. INSIDE THE CHURCH - BACK TO '44 - NIGHT 
BROOM (smiles at the creature) HELLBOY. 
Inside the blanket, Hellboy blinks his bright golden eyes and chews candy, his devilish red tail twitching happily. 
CUT TO: 
HELLBOY - MAIN TITLE 
Montage: Tabloid covers and news clippings screaming HELLBOY SIGHTING IN RENO!! GOVERNMENT DENIAL!!! etc. 
TV Newscasters read lurid copy. SPRINGER excerpts (fist fight included) feature the show's theme: I WAS HELLBOY'S BRIDE!! 
Some blurry, grainy footage depicts Hellboy crossing an alley. Much like Bigfoot in the woods. 
TOM MANNING (V.O.) Look at that. That's a costume. These people amaze me. 
INT. STUDIO T.V. HOST SHOW - INTERVIEW #2 - DAY 
MANNING is a balding, official-looking guy in a suit. 
MANNING With their conveniently blurry footage of their beloved "Hellboy." And they claim that he works for the FBI-? 
SUPER ON TV: 
TOM MANNING, F.B.I. 
HEAD OF SPECIAL OPERATIONS. 
Manning on a TV SHOW a la Regis Philbin. 
TV HOST As the head of your division, you -- You have seen dozens of pictures like this!!! 
MANNING Exactly -- so, why is it that they're all out of focus? C'mon!! God knows, people manage to get good pictures at a wedding!! 
He shows a blurry picture. 
MANNING That's the alleged best man -- ? 
EXT. N.Y. - MANHATTAN STREET - DAY 
Leaves stir on the pavement. All the stores are decorated for Halloween. Two kids dressed as SKELETONS run in front of Broom, carrying a JACK-O-LANTERN. 
Leaning on a cane, Broom exits the building and walks toward a waiting black Mercedes. The DRIVER (Agent Lime) opens the door. 
Broom pauses to buy a dozen BABY RUTH candy bars from a street vendor. 
In an ELECTRONICS STORE, a wall of TV's. The image of a RED, BLURRY SHAPE (HELLBOY) fills the screens. 
BROOM (seeing this) Son... 
TV HOST Mister Manning, what about the "Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defense?" The FBI has been known to conceal -- 
TOM MANNING That word -- conceal -- 
TV HOST from the American public -- 
TOM MANNING Phil -- Phil -- hold your little green horses. Let me tell you and the American public one thing -- this "Bureau for -- what was it? 
TV HOST Paranormal Research and -- 
TOM MANNING -- Defense, right, well -- I'm here to clear up this once and for all. (he looks at the camera) There-is-no-such-thing. 
Broom smiles. 
OMIT 
EXT. B.P.R.D. BUILDING COMPLEX - DAY 
On a wooded, new jersey hill, a low-slung, high-tech complex rests at the edge of a bluff, its foundation fused with the rock below. 
SUPER: BUREAU FOR PARANORMAL RESEARCH AND DEFENSE, NEWARK, N.J. 
EXT. B.P.R.D. COMPLEX - GATE ENTRANCE - DAY 
A dolled-up MOD-STYLE moped stops at the massive gate. Strapped to the luggage rack are two cheap suitcases. The driver, a very wet YOUNG MAN named MYERS, touches an old fashioned buzzer under a sign reading "WASTE MANAGEMENT" 
A crackling INTERCOM VOICE answers. 
INTERCOM VOICE Yes? 
MYERS (shivering) John Myers, F.B.I. Transfer from Quantico. 
A beat, then -- WHIRRR!!! An EYEPIECE and an LCD screen scanner pop out. 
INTERCOM VOICE Look at the birdie, son. 
Myers looks into the eyepiece. On the screen, Myers' cornea is scanned. TWO VIOLET FLASHES. His ID and badge numbers appear. CLACK! The gate opens. 
EXT. UPHILL ROAD - THE MOPED - DAY 
The moped putt-putts towards the building in the distance. 
INT. B.P.R.D. LOBBY - DAY 
Seated at a dramatic circular desk is a solitary guard. Myers approaches. 
MYERS Hello, I'm -- 
LOBBY GUARD -- Late. Five minutes late. 
MYERS Yes, I -- 
LOBBY GUARD -- Section fifty-one. Step back. 
MYERS Pardon? 
LOBBY GUARD Two steps back, please. 
Confused, Myers picks up his suitcases and complies. He realizes he's DEAD CENTER on a giant B.P.R.D. Logo: A HAND HOLDING A SWORD. 
LOBBY GUARD Watch your hands and elbows. 
Immediately, the floor under Myers' feet starts down. He's on a small elevator. 
INT./EXT. OPEN ELEVATOR - ON THE WAY DOWN - DAY 
The panel overhead slides shut. A row of safety lights comes on. 
INT. OPEN ELEVATOR - DAY 
He's in a vast underground area with other elevators moving up and down in the distance. 
INT. B.P.R.D. - CONCRETE CHAMBER 51 - DUSK 
The elevator stops in a narrow, dark space. Neon lights flicker on, illuminating a circular chamber. PAINTED on the floor is a huge number: 51. 
Right in front of Myers: a magnificent oak door. 
They go through a series of pneumatic doors. 
BROOM In 1943, President Roosevelt decides to fight back. THE BUREAU FOR PARANORMAL RESEARCH AND DEFENSE is born. 
Workmen are replacing two of the doors. Big dents from an oversized fist have deformed the 2-inch thick metal plates. Myers stares. 
BROOM 1958, the occult war finally ends when Adolf Hitler dies. 
MYERS 1945, you mean. Hitler died in '45. 
BROOM (enigmatic smile) Did he, now? 
They reach a FINAL DOOR. Stainless steel, like a BANK VAULT. Waiting there is AGENT CLAY, a burly guy in a suit, with a cartful of BEEF AND MASHED POTATOES. A dinner pile at least 4 feet high. 
BROOM Agent Myers, this is Agent Clay. Follow his lead. 
Broom hands Myers two BABY RUTH bars and walks away. 
MYERS You're not coming? 
Broom signals "no." 
BROOM I hand-picked you from a roster of over seventy academy graduates. Make me proud. 
The door closes behind him. 
CLAY They're not speaking. Professor Broom had him grounded. 
MYERS Grounded? Who's grounded? 
CLAY Okay. You saw the fish man, right? 
Myers nods. 
CLAY Well, come on in and meet the rest of the family. 
Clay uses an odd-shaped ELECTRONIC KEY to unlock the door. Three solenoid locks turn. Two steel vertical PISTONS open up. 
INT. HELLBOY'S DEN - NIGHT 
Clay pushes the cart into a solid concrete bunker, windowless, austere except for a few SAMURAI suits of ARMOR and WEAPONS. Dozens of CATS wander around; others are curled up on the furniture. 
There are Zippo's everywhere, from every era. 
On a sofa (made from the bed of a pickup truck) is a heap of blankets and comic books. All in all, a MEGA BACHELOR PAD. 
CLAY (sotto voce) He gets fed six times a day. He's got a thing for cats. You'll be his nanny, his keeper, his best friend. He never goes out unsupervised -- 
MYERS Who?! 
Clay points at a torn comic book: HELLBOY, THE UNCANNY. Myers picks it up, looks at the cover: it shows Hellboy -- in a U.S. Uniform, fighting a monstrous ape. 
Myers watches, amazed, as a bright red TAIL waves in and out of a pool of light about ten feet away. One of the cats playfully paws at it. 
MYERS (sotto voce) You're kidding -- 
HELLBOY Those comics -- They never got the eyes right. 
The voice is a deep baritone, chesty and powerful. 
MYERS (to Clay, sotto voce) Oh, Jesus!! Hellboy -- ?? Is real -- 
CLAY (sotto voce) Yup. Sixty years old by our count. But he doesn't age like we do -- think dog years: He's barely out of his teens. 
Myers gasps, seeing a monumental figure in the shadows, exercising with a 300 lb. Stainless steel DUMBBELL. Crimson biceps like cooked hams. Chomping an unlit CIGAR stub. 
HELLBOY What's with the hair, Clay?? Finally got those implants?? 
Agent Clay blushes as he hides his scalp. 
CLAY It'll fill in. Where do you want your dinner, Red? By the couch? 
On a nearby pile of junked TV sets, a loop of Fleischer cartoons and home movies cycles endlessly. One subject appears over and over: an ATTRACTIVE YOUNG WOMAN with a pale face and raven-black hair. 
HELLBOY Who's the squirt? 
CLAY Agent Myers is your new liaison. 
HELLBOY Got tired of me? 
CLAY Nah. I'll be around, Red, just back in the field. 
BANG!!! Hellboy lets the dumbbell drop. Instinctively, Myers jumps. 
HELLBOY I don't want him. 
CLAY Manning says I'm too soft on you -- (sotto voce, nudging Myers) The candy. Give him the candy. 
Myers remembers he's holding the Baby Ruths. 
The GARBAGE TRUCK pulls into an interior courtyard and stops. 
FBI/BPRD teams spread through the area, expelling uniformed cops and securing the doors. 
THREE AGENTS -- QUARRY, STONE and MOSS -- close a gate, sealing off the area. 
STONE All areas secured. 
From a nearby roof, Agent Lime signals all clear. 
CLAY (into a handheld radio) Seal the doors. Red and Blue are coming in. 
The truck stops, Clay pulls a lever. Myers watches as the dumpster loader hinges down like a drawbridge, revealing HELLBOY and ABE. 
CLAY Okay, boys, let's synch up our locators. 
Abe, Clay and Hellboy activate lights on their belts. They BEEP and blink. Hellboy starts walking. 
OMIT 
INT. MACHEN LIBRARY, MAIN LOBBY - NIGHT 
As BPRD agents clear the area, Clay, Myers, Abe and Hellboy march through the main lobby. On view, various display cases. Two BANNERS flank the marble staircase. 
CLAY (reading a report) At nineteen hundred hours an alarm tripped. B&E. Robbery. Six guards dead -- 
HELLBOY Hold on -- hold on -- I thought we checked this place. Fakes, and reproductions. 
BROOM Apparently not everything was fake. 
Broom stands at the base of the marble staircase. 
HELLBOY (surprised to see him) Father...? 
Myers observes as the red Goliath sheepishly averts his gaze from that of the fragile old man. 
INT. MAIN CORRIDOR / MACHEN LIBRARY (SET) - NIGHT 
They approach an oversize set of brass doors. 
Abe removes a leather glove from his hand. FWAP!! he spreads his webbed fingers on the door. He closes his three eyelids and concentrates. 
Two agents arrive with a rolling munitions case. Myers observes as Hellboy opens it and looks over a potpourri of bullets of all colors and shapes. 
BROOM A 16th century statue was destroyed. Saint Dionysius the Aeropagite. 
HELLBOY Who wards off demons. 
BROOM Smuggled into this country by an overzealous curator. The statue, however, was hollow -- 
HELLBOY Reliquary -- 
BROOM A prison. The Vatican deemed its contents dangerous enough to include it on the List of Avignon. Of which we hold a copy. 
Hellboy selects a clip full of bullets and a speed loader. 
HELLBOY Would'ya look at this babies? Made 'em myself. Holy water, silver shavings, white oak: the works. 
ABE (pulling his hand away) Behind this door. A dark entity -- Evil, ancient and hungry. 
Abe quickly starts scanning a few leather-bound volumes of ancient magic. 
HELLBOY Oh, well. Lemme go in and say "hi". 
As HELLBOY opens the big doors, a flickering amber glow illuminates him. He steps inside. 
INT. "MAGIK EXHIBITION" HALL - NIGHT 
BLUE emergency lamps are on. The exhibits are destroyed; piles of debris are burning. Hellboy walks past a fallen display case. 
He moves around cautiously. A couple of large carvings and statues startle him. 
On the floor: boots, half chewed. Bitten belts and shreds of uniforms and hats. 
HELLBOY (whispers into radio) Blue: It stinks in here -- Finely aged roadkill. 
The sickening sound of snapping bones and mastication reaches his ears. Hellboy reacts to a smell, raises his eyes to discover -- 
A huge pale CREATURE hangs from the ceiling, chewing slowly. SAMMAEL: equipped with powerful arms, a head full of tentacles and two well-muscled hind legs. Most of its face is hidden, but the jaws are shiny with blood. 
HELLBOY Hey. Stinky. Kitchen's closed. (beat) Whatcha havin'? Six library guards, raw? Plus belts and boots? Man, you're gonna need some heavy fiber to move that out -- 
ABE (in earphone) Red, I found something -- 
INT. MAIN CORRIDOR / MACHEN LIBRARY (SET) - NIGHT 
Abe has found a small, medieval engraving of Sammael in one of the books. 
ABE There's not much here: the entity's name is Sammael, the desolate one, son of Nergal -- 
Myers goes for HELLBOY's gun... and grabs it! He takes cover behind the trash container. HELLBOY is there. 
HELLBOY What do you think you're doing?? 
Myers proudly shows him the gun. 
MYERS Helping you -- I just -- 
HELLBOY No one ever helps me. It's my job. 
He grabs his gun and tries to reload, but his arm hurts too much. 
HELLBOY Damn -- Okay. Here -- 
He hands him the gun and a fresh clip. Reaching into his belt, Hellboy extracts a vacuum-sealed packet. 
HELLBOY (throws it at Myers) -- Then load this. 
In the packet: A SINGLE BULLET. 
HELLBOY It's a tracking bullet. Crack the pin. Load it. 
KLANG!!! The tongue punches through the steel like a ramrod. Again and again... Hellboy and Myers can barely dodge it. 
Myers cracks a safety pin. The glass head on the bullet glows like a chemical flare. 
MYERS Jeez... What the hell is that? 
He's looking at Hellboy's smoking arm. Inside a bloody gash, a big, black stinger is gleaming. 
Hellboy pulls it out, then steps on it. It pops like a ripe grape. 
HELLBOY Lemme go ask -- 
Hellboy steps from behind the container. Sammael's tongue instantly wraps around the gun's muzzle. 
BAM! BAM! Hellboy shoots repeatedly. His face lit weirdly green as the tracking bullet lodges within the gun. Then -- BAM!!!! 
INSIDE GUN SHOT 
The glowing bullet flies through the barrel and out towards -- 
EXT. ALLEY 
-- Sammael, still in mid-air. 
It hits him square in the chest: an explosion of green goo!! 
With a shriek, the thing leaps over a wall. Hellboy scrambles after it. 
EXT. LOADING ALLEY - NIGHT 
On the empty sidewalk, Hellboy sees a trail of GLOWING GOOP. 
He hits full stride, following it around a corner. Myers lands a second later, cradling his arm, chasing after him. 
MYERS Wait! No, what are you doing? 
LOADING DOCK / ALLEY 
Sammael dashes by, followed closely by Hellboy, running full tilt. 
A ten-wheeler backs up, effectively blocking their way. A few workers load pumpkin boxes in it. 
WORKER 1 What the hell is that?? 
Without slowing down, Sammael jumps onto the trailer, denting the roof then jumping off and into a CROWDED CARNIVAL area. 
A small carrousel and refreshment stand flank a pumpkin patch. 
Full of curiosity, Sammael pauses a second to inspect a Trick- or-treater dressed as a GOLDEN DRAGON. 
Hellboy catapults himself onto the trailer's roof. 
3 WORKERS (chorus) Whoa-whoa-whoa- 
Hellboy jumps and lands heavily on top of the driver's cab: CRASH!!! 
The driver is almost crushed under the steel. He screams, showered by thousands of glass shards. 
Myers is a few steps behind. 
MYERS (into headset) We'll hit the street in a minute. We're heading towards civilians... 
He squeezes between the vehicle and the alley wall. The vendors are yelling at him. 
MYERS Yeah, yeah, crazy costume, uh? Trick or treat!! 
EXT. WEST SIDE STREET - NIGHT 
Sammael staggers back and -- in an impossible maneuver, re- knits his jaws together! Then he uses his bone scythe to tackle Hellboy and -- TCHAKKKK!! -- pin his shoulder down. A deep wound. 
Sammael's mouth starts to open! Hellboy looks at the sparking THIRD RAIL a few feet away. 
Sammael's tongue rears back, a snake ready to strike. 
HELLBOY Screw you. 
Hellboy grabs the rail. An electrical discharge consumes both creatures and burns the frame like flashpaper. Hellboy lets go, his hand and body smoking. Sammael -- very crispy -- is convulsing in a cloud of smoke. He grows still. 
Wreathed in smoke, Hellboy shakes off the shock and uses a flame on his arm to light a cigar. 
HELLBOY I'm fireproof. (puffs smoke, kicks the body) You weren't. 
OMIT 
EXT. WESTSIDE HIGHWAY - NIGHT 
A huge traffic jam clogs the highway. The totalled 4X4 is being TOWED AWAY. Several TV CREWS interview witnesses. 
Myers -- his arm freshly bandaged -- signs a police form. His radio beeps. 
HELLBOY (V.O.) Myers??? How's your arm? 
MYERS My arm is fine. Where are you?? 
Myers moves away from the POLICE OFFICERS. 
MYERS (sotto voce) Where are you??? 
INT. SUBWAY TRACKS (STUNT TRACK) 
Hellboy walks away from the smoking Sammael carcass. 
HELLBOY I just fried Stinky. Tell Father I'll be home. He shouldn't wait up. 
EXT. WESTSIDE HIGHWAY - SAME 
MYERS Wait -- Wait -- You can't go anywhere -- I gotta go with you -- 
INT. SUBWAY TRACKS (STUNT TRACK) 
HELLBOY No, no, no, it's fine: I do my job, I take a break. 
MYERS (V.O.) No. Stop. Don't do this -- Listen to me -- Tell me where you are -- 
HELLBOY Myers? 
MYERS (V.O.) Yes? 
HELLBOY Goodbye. 
He turns off his belt locator and moves away into the darkness of the tunnel. 
In the foreground: BLACK light escapes from Sammael's charred body. 
INT. MAIN ABANDONED BATHS ALCOVE - NIGHT 
An abandoned shower room. A series of sinks and stalls, lined with dirty white tile. A phonograph nearby plays Wagner. Kroenen stands next to it. 
ILSA is nearby, a straight razor glinting in her hand. She stands over Grigory -- his back to us -- lovingly shaving her master's scalp. She grabs two GLASS EYES from a table. Places them in Grigory's sockets -- his back to us -- as he turns, a glass eye shifts lazily into position. He opens his hand: in it the pale BLACK light that escaped from Sammael's body. He cradles it like a precious stone. 
GRIGORY (smiling) Sammael has fulfilled his destiny... Die in peace and be reborn again and again... 
He closes his fist. 
ILSA Only seven more days to the eclipse, Grishka... 
Rasputin stands, his neck and shoulders rising, engorged by moving flesh beneath his human skin. Ilsa stares in fascination. 
GRIGORY The child will be there. And so will we all -- Won't we? 
Behind him, in the darkness of a tunnel: TWO SAMMAEL silhouettes appear. 
CUT TO: 
OMIT 
EXT. MACHEN LIBRARY ENTRANCE - NIGHT 
A sleek black limo drives past the crowd and stops outside. FBI agent TOM MANNING emerges. 
INT. "MAGIK EXHIBIT" HALL - NIGHT 
Manning and Broom walk through the mess. A crew is cleaning up. The dead guards are carried out. 
MANNING Every time the media get a look at him, they come to me. I'm running out of lies, Trevor. 
BROOM I thought you liked being on TV. 
The flesh on his neck pushes upwards, held by an invisible force. He starts floating in mid-air. 
The blinking lights of arriving police cars tint the windows red and amber. They outline a figure formerly submerged in shadows. GRIGORY. He gestures with both hands, as if holding an imaginary doll. 
His arm muscles twitch under his skin, shifting, changing, gaining strength. 
With a quick gesture Grigory twists the lower and upper parts of the guard's body in opposite directions. 
With a wet CRUNCH, the guard's shadow on the wall goes limp. Grigory looks at Ilsa. 
GRIGORY Ready the welcome, my love -- 
Ilsa opens the reliquary jar and pours a circle of sand onto the floor. 
GRIGORY Salt. Gathered from the tears of a thousand martyrs. Restraining the essence of Sammael, the hell hound, the seed of destruction. 
Grigory slices the air with his open hand, creating fleeting glyphs... and a small BLACK flame dances on his open palm. He deposits it in mid-air, at the center of the circle. 
Then, the sand begins to move, like liquid mercury. Lines fuse into a pile. It melts and bubbles, growing and foaming. Bones are formed, tendons and ligaments join together, GROWING, GROWING, INTO SAMMAEL. 
It roars!!! 
CUT TO: 
OMIT 
INT. MACHEN LIBRARY - NIGHT 
Abe snaps out of it. Broom is pale. He steps away, wincing, enduring a bolt of pain in his side. Abe holds him. Motions for the others to stay back. 
He extends his open palm and "feels" the air near the old man's back. 
ABE Professor..? You -- are very sick -- 
BROOM I don't want Hellboy to know -- 
Broom turns around, gently pushes Abe's hand away. 
BROOM Sixty years ago Abe, they tried to destroy the world. And they are back -- in my lifetime, they are back. To finish the job. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. CENTRAL PARK - NIGHT 
A small nighttime Halloween celebration. Lanterns hanging from the trees, couples drinking and listening to Pop music on picnic tables. 
On a bench, A YOUNG GUY pulls out a cold SIX PACK of beer and passionately kisses his GIRLFRIEND. As he shuts his eyes, a bright, red tail neatly snatches the six-pack. 
Behind the bench, HELLBOY smiles. 
EXT. BELLAMIE MENTAL HOSPITAL - NIGHT 
Dry leaves fly up in a gust of wind. A small army of EMERGENCY VEHICLES roars down the deserted streets, right past a... 
...brick 1940's HOSPITAL, behind a high wall topped with barbed wire. The mesh-covered windows are decorated with paper skeletons and jack-o'-lanterns. A topiary garden surrounds the building. 
Watching from atop the wall is HELLBOY. One sleeve of his overcoat is soaked in blood. He keeps an eye on the SECOND FLOOR windows. Hanging from his tail: THE SIX PACK OF BEER. 
INT. BELLAMIE MENTAL CORRIDOR - NIGHT 
DOCTOR MARSH, a female psychiatrist, moves down a line patients, distributing pills. 
Behind her, a lithe young woman in a patient's gown carries the medicine tray. This is LIZ SHERMAN, age 26, her pale skin contrasting with her raven-black hair and piercing dark eyes. A scar mars her forehead. Three thick rubber bands circle her wrist. 
Near a window, a Down's Syndrome PATIENT senses something. 
DOWN'S PATIENT (pointing) There's a big red guy down there! 
DOCTOR MARSH (readying more pills) That's fine, darling, Santa's not here for another month. 
DOWN'S PATIENT Not Santa. Big and red. With gold eyes. And he has beer! 
Hearing this, Liz stops. She closes her eyes, tugs at one of the rubber bands on her wrist and lets it snap against her skin. She winces and peers out the window. The garden below seems empty. 
EXT. BELLAMIE MENTAL HOSPITAL - GARDEN AREA - NIGHT 
Liz steps out a side door into the hospital garden. Hanging from her neck: an old POLAROID CAMERA. She follows a trail of blood to a large, thorny bush. As she circles it... 
LIZ Back so soon? 
Visible in the branches, a leg and part of Hellboy's overcoat. His tail emerges, dangling the six-pack. 
HELLBOY Uh, I brought beer. 
Liz shoots a Polaroid. 
LIZ To wash down my lithium pills? (beat) I may get a few perks, H.B. But I'm still a patient. 
Shyly, he climbs out from the bush. She sees the bloody arm. 
HELLBOY Don't worry. I'll get him soon enough -- 
BROOM Listen to me. This time is different. There's more at stake than ever before. 
HELLBOY How hard can it be? I punched the crap out of that thing that he sent -- ouch!! 
BROOM I worry about you. 
HELLBOY Me?? C'mon -- 
BROOM Well, I won't be around forever, you know? 
HELLBOY Oh, stop that -- (grimaces in pain) Damn! Be careful, there -- 
ABE Red. How long was it latched onto you? 
HELLBOY I dunno, maybe five seconds -- ow! 
MYERS You want me to hold him down? 
HELLBOY (snickers) That's right, Stud, hold me down. 
ABE Professor... 
Broom moves to Abe's side of the table. Abe is poking at the depths of the wound. 
BROOM (sharp, to Hellboy) Don't look! Turn around. 
HELLBOY Is it bad? 
Broom comes closer, eyes wide: inside the wound on Hellboy's forearm, nestled like ticks, are 3 translucent EGGS. 
Hellboy jumps as Abe plucks the first one out. Abe deposits it in a glass container. 
ABE Touched you five seconds. Laid three eggs. 
HELLBOY Didn't even buy me a drink. 
INT. MEDICAL BAY. EXAMINATION TABLE - LATER 
The computer beeps having finished an analysis. On a monitor, an enlarged color image of one of the throbbing eggs. 
ABE The eggs are very sensitive to heat and light. They need a humid, dark environment to breed. 
Abe picks up an egg with a pair of tweezers, passes it on to Hellboy, who sports a bandage on his arm. 
MYERS Down there. Did you ever loose track of him? 
HELLBOY Well, let's see -- there was that moment, when I had a train on top of my head -- 
Broom frowns, worried. 
BROOM (to Hellboy) We can't risk it: You'll go back to the tracks tomorrow with a group of agents, search the area, top to bottom. 
Myers observes, repelled, as inside the egg a small foetal THING wiggles. 
INT. BROOM´S OFFICE - NIGHT 
Myers stands by Broom's desk as the old man places a new set of books on the reading stands in front of the fish tank. 
MYERS I'm in way over my head, I know that much. 
BROOM You're doing fine. 
At the last book stand, Broom glances at Abe, who is sitting in the shadows near the door. 
MYERS No, I'm not. He respects Clay. Not me. I don't know why you chose me, Sir. But I'm not qualified. 
Discouraged, Myers heads for the door. 
BROOM (very quiet) I'm dying Agent Myers. 
Shocked, Myers looks over at Broom. 
BROOM And as a father, I worry about him. (directly to Myers) In medieval stories, Agent Myers, there's often a young knight, inexperienced but pure of heart... 
MYERS Oh, please. I'm not "pure of heart." 
ABE Yes, you are. 
BROOM What I ask from you is -- Have the courage to stand by his side after I'm gone. Help him find himself. Who he must be. (beat) He was born a Demon... You will help him become a man. 
OMIT 
INT. B.R.P.D. ARCHIVE / CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT 
Dozens of HELLBOY clippings flash by: tabloid headlines along with intimate images of Hellboy as a KID. H.B. at 7, at 12, dressed as a human for Halloween, Broom by his side. 
Myers works at a computer workstation. 
The wall collapses under Hellboy's attack. 
HELLBOY Are you coming or not? 
Clay smiles uncertainly back. Hellboy moves in. 
CLAY (to Quarry and Moss) You two, check this dump, then join us -- 
INT. ABANDONED SHOWER ROOM (SET) - DAY 
A large oval room of rusting metal, with pipes spilling water through a large GRATE on the floor. 
Abe studies it, senses something, and nods. With superhuman effort, Hellboy lifts it. Hundreds of roaches pour out. 
ABE I'm glad I'm not human. This place would be an embarrassment. 
Below, a vast cistern. Abe drops in two CHEMICAL FLARES. 
INT. UNDERWATER - CHAMBER (SET TANK) - DAY 
The flares sink, illuminating floating office furniture and torn paper... 
INT. UNDERWATER CHAMBER 2 (LOCATION: R. WAREHOUSE CELLAR) 
In the lower depths, they pass shadowy industrial ruins. Settling on the bottom they reveal the hulk of a waiting SAMMAEL. 
OMIT 
INT. ABANDONED SHOWER ROOM (SET) - DAY 
Abe pulls off his breathing apparatus. Activates the locator on his utility belt. Hellboy does likewise. BEEEP! The devices synchronize. 
Hellboy extends a metal reliquary containing a small bone. 
HELLBOY There you go, Doctor. This should cover your tailfin -- On loan from the Vatican, a bone from Saint Dionysius. Ugh. Looks like a pinky. 
Abe ties the reliquary around his hand. 
ABE Remind me why I keep doing this. 
HELLBOY Rotten eggs and the safety of mankind. 
ABE Oh, right -- 
As transparent nictomembrane lids cover his eyes, Abe dives. 
INT. UNDERWATER CHAMBER 2 - (LOCATION R.WAREHOUSE) - DAY 
Underwater, ABE finds an entire control room. 1940's magazines float by, like paper jellyfish. The amber light of the chemical flares gives the room an eerie other-worldly feel. 
INT. ABANDONED SHOWER ROOM (SET) - DAY 
Waiting above, Hellboy chews a Baby Ruth and pokes around. Finds a pile of children's shoes covering some yellowing albums. In the albums, a myriad of sad faces, the orphans from the past. 
Some of the faces have been cut out. There's an unfinished letter to Father Christmas, dated 1866. 
Clay stands below a grate, admiring his hair implants with a hand mirror. 
CLAY See? It's thicker. Isn't it? It's not that doll-hair thing -- 
Suddenly, something moves. Hellboy shines his light into an adjoining tunnel. Kroenen is standing there, like a deer caught in headlights. 
HELLBOY Son of a -- ! 
The figure darts away. Hellboy tears after it, gun in hand. 
CLAY Red, wait! 
Clay tries his radio. Static. 
CLAY Red's on the move!! I'll cover him!! 
He pulls out his gun and runs after Hellboy. 
INT. TUNNEL LABYRINTH (SET) - DAY 
Clay arrives at an intersection of sewer tunnels. The glow of Hellboy's flashlight is visible somewhere ahead, his booming footsteps rapidly receding. A veritable labyrinth. 
CLAY Damn it, Red. 
INT. UNDERWATER CHAMBER 2 (LOCATION R. WAREHOUSE) - DAY 
Abe nears the bottom of the cistern. As his feet touch bottom, a cloud of silt fogs the water. He picks out a translucent egg! 
Suddenly, something big glides by. Abe turns: sees nothing. 
He places the egg in a glass canister. Now eggs are floating everywhere, undulating in the water like amber fireflies. Abe swims slowly, collecting them one by one. 
Some of them are snugly wedged between two rusty machines. 
MANNING But not everyone was so lucky. (beat) Two agents died today. Clay probably won't survive the night. You're reckless. 
HELLBOY I knew those men better than you did -- 
MANNING Ah, I see. That makes it all alright then. 
He turns to leave. Hellboy gets up. 
HELLBOY No, it doesn't make it right, but I stopped that creature, didn't I? 
MANNING That's what you do. That's why we need you. You have an insight. (beat) You know monsters. 
HELLBOY What are you trying to say? 
MANNING In the end, after you've killed and captured every freak out there -- there's still one left: you. 
HELLBOY (a deep sigh) I wish I could be more gracious but -- 
BAMMMMM!!!! He smashes a metal LOCKER with his stone hand and raises it above his head. 
Manning cowers, realizing that Hellboy's rage is a dangerous thing. 
INT. B.P.R.D. - MAIN HALL AREA - DAY 
A new space. Office corridors radiate out from a brass B.P.R.D. logo on the floor. A few agents monitor computer stations and tactical glass boards. 
Liz and Myers walk in, carrying her suitcases. She looks around and sees BROOM coming down the hall. 
BROOM Welcome back. 
LIZ It's only for the weekend, Professor Broom. Then I'll be on my way -- 
BROOM (impeccable courtesy) Come and go as you please. (beat) Find your way back. We've made quite a few changes -- 
CRASH!!! Liz screams and Myers draws his gun. Smashing through a glass partition, the mangled steel LOCKER lands in the middle of the hall in a rain of glass and aluminum studs. 
Next, Manning appears, retreating but unharmed. 
MANNING (gasping) I want that thing locked up, starting now -- Now!!! You hear me??!! 
He flees. 
LIZ (to Broom) Nothing's changed. Home, sweet home. 
Mortified, Broom hurries after Manning. Hellboy calmly steps through the hole in the wall. 
HELLBOY (seeing her) Liz? Liz!! 
She spins on her heel and walks off. Hellboy turns to Myers. 
HELLBOY You!!! You did it, buddy -- 
Myers holsters his gun and follows Liz. Hellboy is all alone now. 
HELLBOY (oblivious) Woo hoo!! 
INT. B.P.R.D. - LIZ'S ROOM - DAY 
A familiar cell. Fireproof insulation covers the walls. Liz throws her bags on the bed. Myers lingers in the doorway. 
She reflexively pulls on one of the rubber bands on her wrist, then lets it snap. 
LIZ A little something I learned in therapy. I'm depressed -- (snaps a rubber band) One rubber band. I'm impatient: two rubber bands... 
He sits by her side on the bed. 
MYERS I'll get you a fresh pack. 
INT. HELLBOY'S DEN - DUSK 
A cat bats at a ball of paper. On it, two words are visible: DEAR LIZ. Hellboy's tail scoops up the paper and throws it in a brimming wastebasket. 
He's sitting at a stainless steel desk, deep in concentration, writing with evident difficulty. The floor around him is covered with more crumpled pages. In the background, the projector is showing DUCK SOUP. Myers pushes in a cartload of CHILI. 
MYERS Where do you -- 
HELLBOY Shh! Just a second. 
Myers sets the tray on the table. 
HELLBOY Myers, you're a talker. What's a good word -- a solid word for "need" -- 
MYERS "Need" is a good, solid word. 
HELLBOY Nah, sounds too "needy." 
MYERS Start in, you got nachos coming. 
As he goes out, Liz appears in the doorway. Hellboy quickly stops writing. 
MYERS I admire him. He's a force of nature. 
LIZ He's just pushy. 
MYERS No... He's determined. Unstoppable -- 
LIZ Cocky. 
MYERS Strong. 
LIZ A brute. 
MYERS My uncle used to say... we like people for their qualities but love them for their defects. 
Liz half-smiles, sips her coffee. 
MYERS He -- loves you. 
LIZ I know. 
MYERS What about you? 
LIZ Don't know. Really. I grew up with him. (beat) I've missed him too, but now, every time I see him, I get confused. Hardly a day goes by he's not in my mind. Even now, I feel he's here -- 
As they walk down the street. A red streak jumps over roof tops. 
EXT. ROOFTOP - NIGHT 
Hellboy lands neatly on the adjacent roof. He looks down at Myers and Liz -- 
Myers offers her cream and sugar. 
HELLBOY No cream and sugar, moron. She takes it black. 
She takes the coffee, waves off the half and half. 
HELLBOY Toldya. 
Trying to feel superior, Hellboy chuckles. As they walk, Liz gestures vigorously. His smile fades. 
EXT. NEWARK N.J. STREETS - NIGHT 
MYERS It's freezing, isn't it? 
LIZ Coffee's warming me up. 
By now, all the shops are closed. They approach a small park near a train track. 
MYERS What do we do now? Newark, New Jersey, entertainment capital of the world. 
She cleans off a wet, dirty bench, sits down. 
LIZ You offered me a cup of coffee. I've got one, so just sit down. 
Myers is falling for her. 
EXT. BUILDING ROOFTOP - FIRE ESCAPE - NIGHT 
Hellboy leaps off a building. 
EXT. BUILDING ROOFTOP - NIGHT 
Two red hands appear over the rooftop parapet. Cursing, Hellboy hauls himself up. He finds himself next to a pigeon coop where a YOUNG KID is feeding the birds. 
HELLBOY Hi... 
The kid stares at him. 
KID You're Hellboy. 
HELLBOY Shh. I'm... on a mission. 
He watches as Liz and Myers sit on the bench. 
HELLBOY Don't tell anyone, huh? 
CUT TO: 
INT. HELLBOY'S DEN - NIGHT 
Broom examines the damage to the wall. He turns to see Hellboy's locator belt hanging on the wall. Broom shakes his head. 
LIME Should we send out some scouts? 
Broom motions for him to stop. It's useless, 
BROOM No. Enough. He will never change -- always a child. Always. 
INT. B.P.R.D. MEDICAL BAY - NIGHT 
GRIGORY If only you had him destroyed sixty years ago, none of this would come to pass. But, then, how could you have known? 
Broom is speechless. 
GRIGORY Your God chooses to remain silent. Mine lives within me. 
Rasputin stands, the flesh of his neck and shoulders heaving and twitching beneath his human skin. 
GRIGORY In the frozen waters of the Malaya Nevka, in the darkness of the void: every time I died and crossed over, a little more of the Master came back with me. He disclosed to me the child's true name... Would you like to know it?? 
BROOM I know what to call him. Nothing you can say or do will change that. I call him son. 
Discreetly, Broom removes his rosary and places it on the book. Kroenen settles in behind him. 
BROOM I am ready. 
GRIGORY Good. Now, I'll add two crumbs more: (Kroenen displays his knives) Grief and revenge... 
Kroenen's knife goes in. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. BUILDING ROOFTOP - NIGHT 
The pigeons flutter on the rooftop. 
The pigeon kid sits by Hellboy's side. 
KID Just go down there and tell her how you feel! (Hellboy shakes his head: no) My mom says -- 
HELLBOY It's not that easy, okay? (beat) Plus, you're nine. You're not old enough to give me advice. 
KID (shrugs) Who are those guys?? 
Hellboy turns and sees -- 
TWO of the black B.P.R.D. Sedan cars rounds the corner. 
Agent Lime bounds out of one of the vehicles, grabbing Myers, talking rapidly. Liz screams, covers her ears. 
HELLBOY Something's wrong -- 
OMIT 
INT. B.P.R.D. HALLWAY - NIGHT 
Agents and Bureau employees are crammed into Broom's office doorway. Hellboy, face contorted by grief, pushes through. 
INT. BROOM'S OFFICE - NIGHT 
The room is full of forensics people taking pictures, picking up evidence, etc. Tom Manning is there. Seeing Hellboy, he respectfully steps back. 
Broom's fragile body lies slumped in his chair. At his feet, a pool of blood. Liz enters, then stifles a whimper. 
With tears in his eyes, a disbelieving Hellboy looks at Liz, then at his dead father. He holds Broom's body close to his chest. 
HELLBOY Father -- I'm back. I'm back. I'm back. 
Manning herds everybody out. From the door, Liz blinks back tears as the red giant kneels by the body: a dog with a lost master. 
HELLBOY I wasn't here. You died alone -- 
DISSOLVE TO: 
OMIT 
EXT. BPRD BUILDING - DAY 
It's raining like hell. 
The PALLBEARERS, Manning and Myers among them, load Broom's casket into a HEARSE. Flanking it are two rows of BPRD agents. 
The hearse doors close and the vehicle pulls away. 
Watching like a gargoyle from a distant roof: Hellboy. Rain bounces off his wet overcoat. 
Liz observes him, worried. 
LIZ'S VOICE He hasn't spoken to anyone in three days. Not a word. He doesn't eat, he doesn't sleep... 
INT. MEDICAL BAY - DAY 
Abe, conscious now, but still in the cast, floats upside down, solving a RUBIK'S CUBE. Liz stands by the tank. 
LIZ I've never seen him like this. Never. (beat) Should I stay? With him, I mean? 
She smiles faintly. 
ABE Listen -- I'm not much of a problem solver... (displays the cube) Three decades and I've only gotten two sides. (beat) But I know this much: if there's trouble -- all we have is each other. And I'm stuck here. (beat) So -- Take care of the big monkey for me, will you? 
GENERAL LAPIKOV It's a pleasure doing business with you. Perhaps you have other interests. 
Grigory's voice drips with serene brutality. 
GRIGORY Enjoy the bright metal you've earned. There will be no further transactions. (beat) Only closure. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. THE NIGHT SKY (MATTE SHOT) - NIGHT 
A massive CARGO PLANE slices the white eye of a full moon. A map details the plane's journey over the Black Sea. 
Super: RUSSIAN AIRSPACE - BLACK SEA. 
INT. CARGO PLANE - NIGHT 
As the plane engines DRONE, Myers supervises BPRD agents Lime and Stone, who stencil a large crate: FRAGILE! LIVE CARGO. 
Hellboy and Liz stand around a brightly-lit work table. 
Hellboy shows them the medieval illustration of Sammael. 
HELLBOY "One falls, two shall arise." So: you pop one, two come out. You kill two, you get four. You kill four, you're in trouble. We have to nail 'em all at once. And the eggs. 
MANNING When we do: No mumbo-jumbo. Double- core Vulcan-65 grenades. 
MANNING shows them a set of GRENADE BELTS. 
MANNING We've installed a very handy timer. Set it, walk away. Cable pulls the safety pins, K-boom! Easy to clean, easy to use... 
HELLBOY (interrupts) Those things never work. Never. 
MANNING Each of us gets a belt. 
HELLBOY (shrugs it off) I won't take 'em. They never work. 
Manning looks at Hellboy, irate. 
MYERS I'll carry his -- 
Hellboy wraps Broom's rosary on his wrist. 
HELLBOY Boy Scout.

OMIT 
EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - DAY 
Two gleaming black vans and a truck move through snow-covered Soviet roads. 
Super:  VOLOKOLAMSK FIELDS, MOSCOW. 
EXT./INT. COUNTRYSIDE - IN THE TRUCK CAB - DAY 
Myers and LIZ struggle with a Moscow map. 
LIZ (into a radio) Sparky to Big Red... 
Popping her head out of the window, Liz looks back at the truck bed. 
EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - THE TRUCK BED - DAY 
Fastened to it, the crate labelled: LIVE CARGO. Small breathing holes have been drilled in the sides. 
HELLBOY'S VOICE Sparky?? Who came up with that? Myers? 
EXT./INT. COUNTRYSIDE - THE TRUCK CAB- DAY 
Liz snickers. 
MYERS We're almost there. 
INT. INSIDE THE CARGO BOX - DAY 
Hellboy, sitting on the floor, in the dark. 
LIZ'S VOICE (on radio) We're leaving the main road, so hang on -- 
They hit a series of bumps. The box rattles and shakes. Hellboy bangs his head. The vehicle lurches to a halt. 
HELLBOY (on the radio) This better be the place or I'll puke. 
Motors are turned off. The crate is opened. Liz peeks in. 
LIZ Come out and see. 
EXT. 19TH CENTURY CEMETERY - DAY 
Across a small stone bridge, light pours from a hexagonal structure. 
They step onto the bridge. KLANGGG!!! two gears release a steel door from above, forcing them to forge ahead. 
Somewhere, a  massive clockwork is TICKING. 
MANNING What's that -- 
Hellboy motions for silence. The CORPSE mutters: "IT'S SOMETHING BIG" 
They stare into the darkness. 
MANNING We should go back -- you -- you could tear that door apart -- 
HELLBOY Don't move. We -- 
MANNING -- should go back. Now! 
HELLBOY No. Don't -- 
MANNING I'm in charge. We go back! 
Hellboy yanks Manning just in time. BAMMM!!!! A gigantic metal pendulum swings past and demolishes one third of the bridge a few feet from their feet. It takes Lime and the CORPSE with it. 
Another door on the far end of the bridge shudders downward. 
HELLBOY Son of a -- 
Whoosh! The PENDULUM swings back. It destroys more of the bridge. Manning sprints for all he's worth and crawls under the door. 
Hellboy runs, but chunks of stone disintegrate under his feet. 
The pendulum swings back taking out the final piece of the bridge just as Hellboy rolls under the door -- 
-- and makes it into the hexagonal building. 
INT. STONE CORRIDOR - DAY 
Hellboy and Manning find themselves in a very narrow, arched stone corridor. Its walls are lined with endless rows of rusty steel blades. 
Faint traces of WAGNER can be heard. They cautiously proceed... 
INT. HEXAGONAL STONE LAB - DAY 
There. In yellow gaslight, Kroenen nods attentively as a phonograph plays the love duet from TRISTAN UND ISOLDE. 
Above him, ropes, hooks and pulleys. 
INT. STONE CORRIDOR - DAY 
Manning rest his hand too close to a blade. 
MANNING Ouch!! 
INT. HEXAGONAL STONE LAB - DAY 
Kroenen comes alert. He scans the room, quietly winds himself up. 
INT. STONE CORRIDOR - DAY 
Hellboy shoots a dirty look at Manning and then looks back into the chamber -- 
-- Kroenen is gone. 
HELLBOY (to Manning) Crap. This guy moves like a cockroach -- 
Hellboy readies his gun and then creeps toward the lab. 
INT.  HEXAGONAL STONE LAB - DAY 
Hellboy's footsteps elicit soft creaks from the wooden floor. Manning moves along behind him. 
The record finishes playing. Silence -- 
SWISH!!! Kroenen's whirling blades slice the air, ripping into Manning's arm. As Kroenen goes in for the kill -- 
-- Hellboy thrusts out his stone fist as a shield. Kroenen bears down but Hellboy fends him off with powerful, deliberate blocks. 
Kroenen hauls out one of his long swords. 
HELLBOY Screw that. 
Hellboy yanks it away and bends it like a twig. BAMMMM!!!! He punches Kroenen in the face, crumpling the steel mask, smashing its lenses. 
HELLBOY You killed my father -- 
BAMMM!!!! another hit. 
Kroenen staggers back with each blow. Finally, the mask falls off. 
HELLBOY (closing his eyes) Anung-un-Rama... 
INT. CATACOMBS - NIGHT 
Hellboy's stone arm glows. Ancient symbols of fire burn the stone. Flames momentarily engulf his body. 
INT. CATACOMBS - NIGHT 
Hellboy roars as his HORNS majestically burst forth! Out of his mouth, energy and light boil like condensing breath on a winter's night. 
Inebriated with power, the new PRINCE OF HELL smiles with supreme arrogance. His shadow falls on the white marble of the slab and mysteriously spreads over it until the stone turns black as obsidian. 
MYERS No!! Don't do it!! Listen to me!! 
HELLBOY inserts his enormous paw into the FIRST IMPRINT on the stone slab -- CLACK!! He turns it, like a lock. 
A beam of crimson light shoot upwards into the sky. 
EXT. VIEW FROM THE CITY - NIGHT 
Visible from all over Moscow, the beam blazes to the moon! The same phenomenon as in the prologue, but this time it's more intense, with ripples and haloes. 
INT. THE OTHER SIDE - NIGHT 
Again, the infinite, starry space. Again, the OGDRU JAHAD. The ruby beam pierces the darkness. 
INT. CATACOMBS - NIGHT 
Hellboy watches as the FIRST IMPRINT disappears. In its place: a burning glyph. 
Myers struggles with his bindings. The rough hemp cuts his skin, but he manages to free one hand. 
EXT. ON THE OTHER SIDE - NIGHT 
OGDRU JAHAD shifts, suddenly breaking free. Gelatinous limbs uncurl, expand. Its enormity puzzles the eye, obscuring the frame. 
INT. CATACOMBS - NIGHT 
Hellboy thrusts his hand into the SECOND IMPRINT. CLACK! He turns it. 
Myers spots the broken rosary and reaches for it -- 
INT. THE SKY - NIGHT 
IN THE STORM CLOUDS, LIGHTNING ILLUMINATES GARGANTUAN TENTACLES REACHING INTO THE EARTHLY PLANE. 
INT. CATACOMBS - NIGHT 
Grigory drinks in the first signs of the arrival and laughs. 
GRIGORY The final seal. Open it! 
Hellboy puts his hand inside, CLACK!!! Before he can turn it, Myers reaches the rosary. Ilsa lunges at him. He clobbers her full in the face. She staggers back and down. 
MYERS (to Hellboy) Remember who you are!!! 
He throws the rosary at Hellboy. Instinctively, Hellboy catches it. It smokes in his hand. 
He tosses it away. It lands next to the explosive belts. 
Hellboy opens his palm, seeing the smoking, charred imprint of the cross and beads. He looks over at Grigory. 
With a blood-curdling scream, Hellboy grabs his horns with both hands, brutally snaps them off. Energy spews from the stumps. 
He stabs Grigory with one of them. Grigory drops to his knees, holding his stomach. Hellboy drops the blood-stained horn. 
The final lock disappears into the stone. The light flickers and the connection with the moon is broken. 
Ilsa, licking her bloody lips, looks up. The sky is silent. The thunderclouds are parting. The eclipse has ended. 
Grigory crumples in agony. 
The burning glyphs in Hellboy's stone hand dim down, his features and body resume their usual shape. All is quiet. 
GRIGORY You will never fulfill your destiny. You will never understand the power inside you. 
HELLBOY I can live with that. 
He breaks Myers' chains, helps him up. 
INT. CATACOMBS - NIGHT 
Hellboy painfully takes Liz's limp body in his arms. Myers stands by his side. 
He kisses her forehead, caresses her hair, then walks down the steps. 
Myers steps on something. He looks under his foot: A smashed GLASS EYE. Then... out of the silence, a WHISPER. 
GRIGORY Child...
