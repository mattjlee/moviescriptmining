SHOOTING DRAFT February 11, 2008 
FADE IN: 
1 EXT. RAIN FOREST, OLYMPIC NATIONAL PARK, WASHINGTON - DAWN 
Moss-draped. Shadow-drenched. Tortured tree trunks twist upward, reaching for rare sunlight. 
BELLA (V.O.) I'd never given much thought to how I would die.. 
Suddenly, every creature in the forest is deadly silent. Neither bird, beast nor insect make a noise. A predator is near. 
Then, in the distance, hear a tiny SNICK - a twig snapping. Abruptly, we're on the move. Fast. 
UNKNOWN POV - MOVING 
Trees start whipping past us at a dizzying speed, branches are dodged with preternatural agility. And we're speeding up, chasing something. It's exhilarating. Terrifying. Finally, up ahead, we get the first glimpse of our prey - 
A DEER 
-- running for its life as it darts through this maze of a forest. It sprints forward, but we gain on it. Beyond the deer, SEE the forest's edge ahead, white sunlight glowing against the trees. The buck races for the light. We're just behind it, about to emerge from the shadowy darkness - 
The deer LEAPS into the light in a high arc, hovering (suddenly SLOW MOTION) against the WHITE GLARE of the sun... then BAM! 
The deer abruptly plummets out of frame at an unnatural angle, leaving the WHITE GLARE to fill the screen. HOLD ON WHITENESS 
BELLA (V.O.) 
But dying in the place of someone I love seems like a good way to go.. 
-- Then into the WHITENESS steps the face of - 
2 ISABELLA SWAN, 172 
Eyes closed against the sunlight, absorbing its rays. Long, dark hair frames alabaster skin. She's a vulnerable, introverted, imperfect beauty. 
BELLA (V.O.) 
... So I can't bring myself to regret the decision that brought me here to die... 
The background comes into focus as we realize we're now in - 
EXT. SCOTTSDALE, AZ - DAY 
Bella stands at the end of a cul-de-sac on the desert's edge. The sun blazes behind her -- she bends down and carefully scoops a tiny BARREL CACTUS into a clay pot. 
BELLA (V.O.) 
... The decision to leave home. 
She stares at the cactus in a state of reverie, until 
BLONDE #1 (O.S.) Bye, Bella! 
BELLA'S POV - McMansion ACROSS THE STREET 
Three tanned, athletic, blonde GIRLS hop into a convertible Mercedes. Their flawless, bought-and-paid for beauty contrasts with Bella's pale naturalness. They wave. 
BLONDE # Good luck at your new school! 
They ADLIB superficial good wishes, "Don't forget to write;" 
"We'll miss you." Bella waves back, sweetly, but halfheartedly as she steps off the curb. 
BELLA Have a good.. 
--and trips. When she rights herself, they're already gone. 
BELLA ... life. 
Clearly, not close friends. Bella's grown-up demeanor and innate intelligence become apparent as - 
BELLA'S MOTHER, RENE, mid 30's --exits their house --it's low rent for this ritzy neighborhood. Rene is eclectic, scattered, anxious, more best friend than parent. She thrusts a cell phone at Bella. 
RENE It won't work again, baby. 
BELLA You put it on hold. 
RENE I did? 
BELLA Look. You also called Mexico. 
They both laugh -- recalling an especially bad dinner. 
CHARLIE How was school? Meet anyone? 
BELLA A few people... Do you know the Cullen family? 
CHARLIE (looks up sharply) Are people talking about them again? 
BELLA No... well, a little. 
CHARLIE Just cause they're newcomers. We're lucky to have a surgeon like Dr. Cullen at our podunk hospital. Lucky his wife wanted to live in a small town. Lucky his kids aren't like a lot of the hell-raisers around here. 
BELLA ... Okay. 
CHARLIE I just don't like narrow mindedness. 
And he returns to his food. Silence. 
25 INT. BELLA'S ROOM - NIGHT 25 
Bella looks out at the fog as she talks on the phone. 
RENE (O.S. If spring training goes well, we could be living in Florida permanently. 
TELEPHONE OPERATOR (O.S.) Please insert 25 cents to continue. 
BELLA Mom, where's your cell? 
INTERCUT WITH: 
26 EXT. GAS STATION/GARAGE - NIGHT 26 
Rene talks on a pay phone, her dead cell phone in her hand. In the b.g., Phil and an Attendant work on the Subaru engine. 
RENE Ok, I didn't lose my power cord. It ran away. Screaming. I literally repel technology now. 
Bella smiles, missing her mom. Rene feeds the phone quarters. 
RENE 
Now, tell me more about your 
school, baby. What are the kids 
like? Are there any cute guys? 
Are they being nice to you? 
BELLA 
(a beat, lying) 
They've all been really.. 
welcoming. 
PUSH IN ON BELLA'S FACE, getting mad all over again as.. 
FLASH POP TO -EDWARD'S FACE, HIS COAL BLACK EYES, THE FURY.. 
SMASH TO: 
27 EXT. HIGH SCHOOL - MORNING (BEFORE SCHOOL) 27 
ON BELLA, sitting atop a table, an open book in her lap. But her eyes are on the arriving kids, and the parking lot as they pull in. She's waiting for Edward. 
Jessica, Angela, Mike and Eric kick around a soccerball nearby. They wave Bella to join them but she smiles, declining... and returns to watching for Edward. Her face tells us she's ready for a confrontation. 
28 INT. BIOLOGY CLASS - SAME DAY 28 
Bella strides in... but stops, surprised to find her lab table empty. Off Bella, frustrated.. 
BEGIN A SERIES OF SCENES OVER SEVERAL DAYS: 
29 INT. CAFETERIA - DIFFERENT DAY 29 
Bella sits with Jessica and Angela who watch a YouTube video on their phone. Bella gives it a cursory look, but is focused on the Cullen table --only four of them. Edward's seat is empty.. 
30 INT. GIRLS BATHROOM - DIFFERENT DAY 30 
Bella washes her hands, then looks up at the mirror, startled to find Rosalie and Alice behind her. They study Bella, Rosalie with chillingly cold eyes, Alice with curiosity. Bella, uneasy, hurries out. 
31 EXT. FORKS HIGH SCHOOL - DIFFERENT DAY 31 
Bella exits with Angela, Mike, Jessica and Eric, becoming a part of this circle. 
She now only glances at Rosalie's car, a red M3 BMW, as it drives past, noting, again, four Cullens, no Edward. Bella returns to her friends, finally forgetting about him.. 
SERIES OF SCENES ENDS as we go to 32 INT. CHARLIE'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - MORNING 32 It's neater, rearranged more attractively. Clearly, Bella's given it her touch. She sweeps through, folding Charlie's fleece jacket, straightening up. She grabs her book bag BELLA Dad, I'm heading out. 33 EXT. CHARLIE'S HOUSE (CONTINUOUS) - MORNING 33 ON BELLA'S FACE as she opens the door and stops, dismay filling her. It's pouring down rain --the yard is full of puddles, some frozen. Bella shivers, wraps her coat tight. BELLA Great. WHIP PAN to the driveway as Charlie pulls in -driving her truck. BELLA Dad, I can drive myself to school. 
As she walks down the steps, she doesn't realize, something's watching her - UNKNOWN POV - FROM THE TREES --tracking Bella's every move as she slips and falls on a 
She slides him the microscope. He glances through the lens. 
EDWARD Prophase. 
BELLA (muttering) Like I said. 
He writes it on the worksheet. Then he takes a breath, as if trying calm himself, and turns to her with enormous effort. 
EDWARD Enjoying the rain? 
BELLA Seriously? You're asking me about the weather? 
EDWARD It appears. 
BELLA No. I don't like the cold. Or the wet. Or the gray. Or parkas. Or turtle necks. 
Is that a smile playing on his lips? For the first time, he seems more intrigued than agonized. He studies her. She still can't tell if he despises her or not. It's infuriating. 
BELLA 
What? 
He shakes his head and turns to the microscope, switching out 
the slides. She looks at him. And keeps looking.. 
BELLA'S POV - ECU ON EDWARD'S FACE 
His cheekbones, his lips. So perfect, like a sculpture.. EDWARD 
Anaphase. She snaps out of it. Covers with a dry look. BELLA May I? 
(she looks through the lens) Anaphase. 
EDWARD Like I said. 
She glances at him, and this time sees a smirk. She simply holds out her hand for another slide. 
EDWARD 
(handing her the slide) If you hate cold and rain, why move to the wettest place in the continental U.S. 
BELLA It's complicated. 
EDWARD I think I can keep up. 
He actually seems interested. She looks into the microscope as 
BELLA My mother remarried. 
EDWARD Very complex. So you don't like him. 
BELLA Phil is fine. Young for her, but nice enough. 
(re: the slide) Interphase. 
CUT ON THE SCHOOL BELL: 
36 INT. HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER 36 
Bella exits holding the golden onion, and practically runs into Edward, who's directly in front of her. 
EDWARD 
Why didn't you stay with your mom 
and stepdad? 
He waits for her answer, studying her, as if trying to decipher her. She's drawn in by his attention, oddly compelled. 
BELLA 
Alright, Phil's a minor league 
baseball player, so he travels a 
lot. My mother stayed home with me 
but it made her unhappy. So I 
decided to spend time with my 
father. 
EDWARD But now you're unhappy. 
BELLA No... I -- I just.. 
Bella turns away -- embarrassed, vulnerable. 
EDWARD 
Charlie abruptly pulls the curtain between them. 
BELLA It would have been a lot worse if Edward hadn't knocked me out of the way. 
CHARLIE Edward? Your boy? 
Dr. Cullen quickly looks back at the chart. Bella's intuition flickers, sensing he knows something. She presses. 
BELLA It was amazing he got to me so fast. He was nowhere near me. 
DR. CULLEN (smiles) As long as you're safe. 
INT. HOSPITAL - RECEPTION - DAY 39 
Charlie and Bella exit the treatment area. 
CHARLIE I just have to sign some paperwork. You better call your mom. 
BELLA You told her?! She's probably freaking. 
He shrugs and hurries off. Bella shakes her head, pulls out her cell phone. Is about to dial, but then sees down the hall.. 
BELLA'S POV - EDWARD, ROSALIE, AND DR. CULLEN 
Rosalie is clearly furious at Edward who stands his ground. Dr. Cullen plays intermediary. 
ROSALIE This isn't just about you, it's about all of us - 
Dr. Cullen sees Bella and stops Rosalie 
DR. CULLEN Let's take this in my office. 
Rosalie glares at Edward as she goes off with Dr. Cullen. Edward adopts a nonchalant air as Bella approaches, determined. 
BELLA Can I talk to you for a moment? (off his nod) How did you get over to me so quickly? 
EDWARD I was standing right next to you. 
BELLA You were next to your car, across the lot. 
He steps closer to her. His expression turns icy hard. 
EDWARD 
No, I wasn't. 
She won't be bullied. Steps closer to him. 
BELLA Yes. You were. 
EDWARD You're confused. You hit your head. 
BELLA I know what I saw. 
EDWARD And what, exactly, was that? 
BELLA You stopped that van. You pushed it away. 
EDWARD No one will believe that. 
BELLA I wasn't planning to tell anyone. 
This registers with Edward. They're inches from each other, the tension thick. 
BELLA I just want to know the truth. 
EDWARD Can't you just thank me and get over it? 
BELLA 
Thank you. 
A long beat as they look at each other, angry, defensive... and without a doubt, attracted. 
EDWARD You're not going to let it go, are you? 
BELLA No. 
EDWARD (turns, walks away) Then I hope you enjoy disappointment. 
BELLA Why did you even bother? 
He stops, a beat. Looks back at her, unexpectedly vulnerable. 
EDWARD ... I don't know. 
And he keeps walking. Off Bella, confused, frustratingly attracted, and absolutely determined to find out the truth. 
BELLA (V.O. That was the first night I dreamed of Edward Cullen.. 
40 DREAM SEQUENCE - UNDERWATER 40 
JESSICA Guess who just asked me to prom! 
Bella smiles. 
JESSICA I totally thought Mike was going to ask you, Bella. Is it gonna be weird? 
BELLA No way. Zero weirdness. You guys are great together. 
JESSICA I know, right? 
Giddy, Jessica rushes to catch up with Angela. Bella heads out the door that leads to 
EXT. COMMUNITY COLLEGE GREENHOUSE - THE BUSES (CONTINUOUS)44 
--where everyone's looking at the COMPOST WORM BOX, grossing each other out with the slimy creatures. As Bella backs away, Edward steps up. 
EDWARD Bella, it would be better if we weren't friends. 
BELLA 
(wounded) Too bad you didn't figure that out earlier. 
(MORE) 
BELLA (cont'd) You could have let the van crush me and saved yourself all this regret. 
EDWARD (snapping, angry) You think I regret saving you? 
BELLA I know you do. 
EDWARD (furious) You don't know anything. 
His harshness stings her. Suddenly, Alice appears at Edward's side. She eyes Bella with curiosity. 
ALICE The bus is leaving. (to Bella) Hi. Will you be riding with us? 
EDWARD No. Our bus is full. 
He purposefully walks Alice away. But he glances back at Bella with, is that... remorse? She doesn't see it. 
INT. CHARLIE'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - EVENING 45 
Bella enters, throws down her book bag and coat, still angry. She starts upstairs but Charlie enters from the kitchen. 
CHARLIE Your mother called. Again. 
BELLA Your fault, for telling her about the accident. 
CHARLIE She always did know how to worry. 
(hint of sadness) But... she's changed, too. She seems happy. Phil sounds all right. 
BELLA He is. 
She continues upstairs, glancing at her parents' WEDDING PHOTO. Off Bella's FACE, we MATCH CUT - 
46 INT. HIGH SCHOOL - CAFETERIA - ON BELLA'S FACE - DAY 46 
-- as she pushes through the doors. She glances over at the CULLEN TABLE, Edward with his siblings. He doesn't look at her. Anger and determination set in again as Bella joins Eric, Jessica, Mike and Angela. She drops her book bag on a seat 
ERIC La Push, baby. You in? 
BELLA Should I know what that means? 
MIKE La Push beach, down on the Quileute rez. We're all going after school. Big swell coming in. 
ERIC And I don't just surf the internet. 
JESSICA Eric, you stood up once. On a foam board. 
ANGELA There's whale watching, too. Come with. 
ERIC La Push, baby. 
BELLA I'll go if you stop saying that. 
47 THE SALAD BAR STATION - MINUTES LATER 47 
Bella artfully designs an architectural salad. As she reaches for an APPLE, Edward is suddenly next to her 
EDWARD (charmed) Edible art.. 
Startled, she fumbles and drops the apple -- Edward catches it with his foot, hackeysack style, then bounces it back into his hand, the red of the apple, stark against his pale skin. He presents it to her with small smile. 
BELLA Thanks... but your mood swings are giving me whiplash. 
EDWARD I said it would be better if we weren't friends, not that I didn't want to be. 
BELLA What does that even mean? 
EDWARD It means if you were smart, you'd avoid me. 
Bella gives him her best alluring smile. 
BELLA I can keep a secret.. 
JACOB 
(laughing) It's just an old scary story. Did you know the Quileutes are supposedly descended from wolves? 
BELLA Like fur, fangs ... doggy breath? 
Jacob chuckles. Bella smiles and prompts him to continue.. 
BELLA So the legend about the Cullens is.. 
JACOB Well, they're supposedly descended from this, like.. 
(in a spooky voice) 
enemy clan. ... But they claimed to be different, so we made a treaty with them. 
BELLA Didn't they just move here? 
JACOB Or just moved back. 
BELLA Riiiight. So what was this treaty? 
JACOB 
(whispering) If they promised to stay off Quileute lands, we wouldn't expose what they really were to the pale-faces.. 
Jacob pauses dramatically --Bella shivers. 
GIRL (O.S) AAAAAAAAGH!!!!!! 
Bella JUMPS at the bloodcurdling scream, as Angela runs past, chased by Eric waving a dead crustacean. Jacob smirks and starts back to the group. 
BELLA Wait... what were they really? 
JACOB (laughing) It's just a story, Bella. 
Off Bella, with more unanswered questions.. 
50 EXT. SHACK COMMUNITY ON THE RIVER - LATE AFTERNOON 50 
A collection of haphazard shacks and boat docks, connected by wood plank sidewalks. FIND Waylon Forge (the hippy logger who used to play Santa Claus) scraping paint off his boat, swigging a pint as he listens to his prehistoric Walkman. 
His old DOG lies next to him as the sounds of the forest and river chirp and buzz. Waylon sings along to his Walkman.. 
Suddenly, the sounds of nature abruptly SILENCE themselves. The dog raises his head, starts to GROWL. Waylon doesn't notice. 
STAY ON WAYLON, singing, working... until he looks up and realizes the dog's gone. 
WAYLON Jerry? 
Waylon pulls off the headphones. WHISTLES. No dog. Waylon walks up a walkway... then sees a DOG LEG, sticking out from under a bush. 
WAYLON Come on, Jerry, you old mutt.. 
He pulls at the leg. It's detached. He reels back, stumbling onto his boat, frantically untying the line and pushing out 
ON THE WATER - Waylon floats, breath short, listening acutely. 
WAYLON'S POV -ON THE WOODS lining the river. Ominous darkness. A NOISE. He jerks around. Nothing. Then suddenly, his boat ROCKS violently; he spins 
A MAN - now stands on the bow. JAMES, 30, pale white. A vampire. But his eyes, unlike the Cullens, are a deep, sinister BURGUNDY, and absolutely lethal. His catlike movements are always on the edge of a crouch. 
WAYLON H-how did you do that? 
JAMES Always the same inane questions.. 
Waylon turns but a woman LEAPS onto the bow --it's VICTORIA, 26, chaotic red hair filled with leaves from the woods. Terrified, Waylon spins around to see LAURENT, 28, glossy black hair, olive skin, lounging on his boat seat. All three Nomads wear frayed clothes, and all three are bare foot. 
JAMES What do you want? 
VICTORIA Why are you doing this? 
LAURENT (sighs, slight French accent) ... James, must we? 
JAMES The question should be, will it hurt? 
Victoria grins sadistically. Then with lightening fast speed, the three of them VIOLENTLY LUNGE 
SMASH TO BLACK: 
51 FADE IN ON EDWARD'S FACE AGAINST BLACKNESS 51 
SNAPSHOTS of his eyes, his cheekbones, his lips.. 
52 INT. BELLA'S ROOM - ON HER FACE - MORNING 52 
As she sits in front of her computer, lost in thought. She shakes herself out of it and types into her search engine Quileute legends, Olympic Peninsula. An AD pops up, Thunderbird & Whale Book Store, Port Angeles. Bella, intrigued, clicks on it.. 
She looks to her left; the other TWO GUYS are there. She's cornered. She takes her purse from around her shoulder. 
BELLA Look, just take my bag. 
FRAT BOY # We don't want your bag. 
She takes a defensive stance and wraps the strap around her wrist to use her purse as a mace. They chortle derisively. But when Frat Boy #1 comes near, she swings it, hits him in the groin. The BOOK in her bag doubles him over. The other three laugh, and start to close in. But suddenly 
HEADLIGHTS blind them. A silver Volvo screeches up. The Frat Boys dive out of the way. The passenger-side door opens. It's Edward. She's too stunned to even move. 
EDWARD Get in. 
She finally does. But Frat Boy #2 jumps into the game and rushes Edward's side of the car 
Edward SCREECHES to a halt and is out of the car and facing Frat Boy #2 so fast, neither the Frat Boys, nor Bella, see it. Nor does Bella see Edward's GLARE, so chilling, so animalistic in its fury that Frat Boy #2, scared, instinctively backs off. As Edward climbs back into the car, Bella just stares at him. 
59 INT. EDWARD'S CAR - DRIVING - NIGHT 59 
Bella continues to stare. She sees that he's seething with anger, hands gripping the steering wheel, jaw clenched. 
BELLA What -- no, how did you find -- 
EDWARD (through gritted teeth) I should go back and rip their heads off. 
BELLA No. Bad idea. 
EDWARD You don't know the vile, repulsive things they were thinking. 
BELLA And you do? 
EDWARD (covering) Not hard to guess. 
60 EXT. WATERFALL RESTAURANT - FRONT ENTRANCE - NIGHT 60 
Jessica and Angela exit the restaurant as Bella approaches. 
ANGELA Where were you!? We left you a message. 
JESSICA We waited, but we were starving 
Then they see Edward behind her, climbing out of his car. They freeze, agog. He's composed now, making an effort to be charming. And they are charmed. 
EDWARD Sorry I kept Bella from dinner. We ran into each other and got talking. 
JESSICA I - we - understand. We were just... leaving, so 
The two girls start to go. Bella is forced to go with them. 
BELLA Okay, well. Thank you. 
She starts to follow the girls. Edward is torn, then abruptly 
EDWARD 
(abruptly) Maybe I should make sure Bella gets something to eat. 
(off Bella's surprised 
look) ... If you'd like. Then I could drive you back myself. 
ANGELA That's so... thoughtful. 
JESSICA Really thoughtful. 
BELLA (debates, then decides) I could eat. 
As he guides her off, the two girls share a look, and a noiseless scream of excitement. 
EXT. WATERFALL RESTAURANT - DINING PATIO - NIGHT 61 
Bella and Edward sit on the deck. A dramatic waterfall shimmers behind them. 
A waitress places a steaming plate of mesquite roasted salmon in front of Bella and nothing in front of Edward. She exits. 
BELLA You're not eating? 
EDWARD I'm on a special diet. 
BELLA Like South Beach? 
EDWARD Not exactly. 
She looks at him curiously as she takes a bite. 
BELLA So how bout some answers? 
EDWARD Yes, no. To get to the other side, and 1 point 772453851. 
BELLA I didn't ask for the square root of pi. 
EDWARD You knew that? 
But she clings tighter. Terrified. They climb in altitude. Higher and higher, above the fog layer. Finally, up ahead 
THE FOREST'S EDGE fast approaches, a clearing is beyond. The sunlight glows white hot beyond the trees... they're about to emerge from the shadowy darkness... but suddenly- 
Bella finds herself sitting on the ground, against a tree. All is silent. She's dizzy, tries to regain her equilibrium. Then she realizes she's alone. 
BELLA Edward? Where are you? 
She rises, then steps just beyond the fringe of the ferns into 
70 EXT. A MEADOW (CONTINUOUS) - DAY 70 
A perfect circle of swaying grass, wildflowers and buttery sunlight. HEAR a stream nearby. Bella looks around and finally sees 
EDWARD, his shirt open, standing nearby in the shade of some trees. He watches her cautiously. She takes a step toward him, but he holds up a hand. She waits. Finally, he takes a deep breath, and steps out of the shade 
EDWARD 
This is why we don't show ourselves 
in sunlight.. 
As the sun hits him... EDWARD'S SKIN literally sparkles as if embedded with thousands of tiny diamonds. He is magnificent, shimmering, like a statue carved from glittering crystal. He moves toward her. 
EDWARD This is what I am. 
He nears, clearly expecting her to recoil, but.. 
BELLA You're... beautiful.. 
He realizes that she's in awe. She reaches to touch him, but he immediately backs into the shadows, his skin normal again. 
EDWARD 
(appalled) Beautiful? I'm a killer, Bella. This is the skin of a killer. 
His arm juts into A SHAFT OF LIGHT, sparkling again. 
BELLA I don't believe that. 
EDWARD Because you believe the lie. The camouflage. I'm the world's most dangerous predator. Everything about me invites you in - my voice, my face, even my smell. As if I need any of that.. 
He's suddenly BEHIND her --then IN FRONT of her --then by a tree, DARTING so fast, we only see where he lands 
EDWARD As if you could outrun me. As if you could fight me off. 
He abruptly rips off a LARGE TREE LIMB, then THROWS it against a tree trunk with explosive force. 
Bella flinches, but holds her ground, unshakable. 
EDWARD I'm designed to kill. 
BELLA I don't care. 
EDWARD I've killed people. 
BELLA It doesn't matter. 
EDWARD I wanted to kill you. I've never wanted a human's blood so much in my life. I'm dangerous to you. 
BELLA I trust you. 
EDWARD Don't. 
BELLA I trust you, Edward. I'm here. 
She takes his hand. He reels at the warmth of her touch. She leans in, drawn to him, unaware that her THROAT is nearing his lips... then suddenly he's gone. 
BELLA Edward? 
She looks over to FIND he's on the other side of the meadow, catching his breath. 
EDWARD You... took me by surprise. (collecting himself) I don't know how to... do this. 
He moves back toward her. Slowly. 
EDWARD Me, and my family, we're different from others of our kind. We're not nomadic, we have a permanent home. We only hunt animals. We've learned to control our thirst.. 
(shaking his head) But you - your scent, it's like a drug to me... my own personal brand of heroin. 
BELLA (realizing) Oh... I thought you hated me when we met. 
EDWARD I did. For making me want you so badly. I'm still not sure I can control myself. 
He reaches her again. 
BELLA I know you can. 
He's utterly vulnerable as he looks at her, searching her face for clues. 
EDWARD I wish I could understand this thing you see in me. You look at me with those eyes.. 
They walk along a stunning coastline -- rugged black rocks, covered in bright green moss. 
EDWARD ... No, that's just Carlisle. He would never do... this, to someone who had another choice. 
BELLA So Carlisle's the reason why you hunt animals, instead of people. 
EDWARD Not the only reason. 
He stops, looks down at her, serious, with emotion.. 
EDWARD I don't want to be a monster. 
She nods. Understands. He smiles. 
EDWARD We call ourselves vegetarians, by the way... For our kind, hunting animals is like living on tofu. It keeps you strong but isn't very satisfying. 
Then abruptly, he whips past Bella. She turns to see him standing on a large rock in the river. 
BELLA Show off. 
EDWARD It's not that impressive, really. Anyone in my family can do this. 
BELLA Can they all read minds, too? 
EDWARD No, that's unique to me. But Alice can see the future. 
BELLA 
(fishing) Really? Bet she saw me coming a mile away. 
She notes his change of mood as he slows, darkening. 
EDWARD Her visions are very subjective. The future can change. 
He cuts off her questions by returning to shore, and continuing their walk.. 
75 EXT. CHARLIE'S HOUSE - TWILIGHT (ANOTHER DAY) 75 
Water sprays from a hose as Bella and Edward wash her truck. A boom box PLAYS. He perches on top of the roof. 
EDWARD Come to my house tomorrow. 
Bella looks up, aiming the hose badly - water ricochets off the cab and sprays in her face. He jumps down from the roof. 
BELLA Your house? With your family? 
He wipes down the dented front fender, then reaches under it and, with his bare hands, easily pops a large DENT out of the truck's body. She's too flustered to register it. 
BELLA But... what if they don't like me? 
EDWARD 
(laughing heartily) You're worried, not because you'll be in a houseful of vampires, but because you think they won't approve of you? 
BELLA I'm glad I amuse you. 
But then his laughter dies, as he hears something. 
BELLA What is it? 
EDWARD A complication. 
... as a BLACK CAR comes into view, and pulls up. 
EDWARD I'll pick you up tomorrow. 
He heads to his car, eying the passengers in 
EDWARD'S POV - INT. BLACK CAR 
Jacob, with his father, Billy, who's expression is intense. Anxious. SLOW MOTION as Edward locks eyes with Billy. Jacob looks questioningly at his father. 
Bella watches Edward drive away, perturbed by the exchange. She forces a smile and goes to greet the visitors. Jacob sets up Billy's wheelchair and Billy climbs into it as 
BELLA Come to visit your truck? 
JACOB Looks good. You got that dent out. 
BILLY Actually, we came to visit your flat screen. First Mariners game of the season. Plus Jacob here kept bugging me to see you again. 
JACOB (mortified) Great, Dad. Thanks. 
Jacob shoots his father an irritated look, just as the POLICE CRUISER pulls up. Charlie climbs out, holding two six-packs. 
CHARLIE Pale Ale. 
BILLY (holds up a brown paper BAG) Harry Clearwater's homemade fish fry. 
Charlie smiles, pleased. He clicks on the game as they all head inside 
BILLY Any luck with the Waylon case? 
-- Bella exits behind Rosalie, trying to explain. The other's follow - 
BELLA I just assumed -- because you don't eat, you know.. 
ESME Of course. That was very considerate of you. 
EDWARD (re: Rosalie) Ignore her. I do. 
ROSALIE Yes, let's keep pretending this isn't dangerous for all of us. 
BELLA I would never, ever tell anyone. 
DR. CULLEN (reassuring) She knows that. 
EMMETT The problem is, you two have gone public now, so.. 
ESME 
Emmett. 
ROSALIE No, she should know. 
(to Bella) The entire family will be implicated if this ends badly. 
BELLA ... Badly? 
This hangs in the air, uncomfortably. Edward can't look at her. 
BELLA 
(realizing) Oh. Badly. Like, where I become a meal. 
Emmett chokes back laughter. Edward grins. Wraps his arm around Bella. Even Esme has to chuckle. 
Rosalie, exasperated, heads back into the kitchen. Emmett shrugs, goes after her. 
ALICE (O.S. Hi, Bella! 
ON THE BALCONY Alice leaps over the rail, holding a bouquet of wildflowers. Jasper follows her. She bounces forward to kiss Bella's cheek and hands Bella the wildflowers. 
ALICE 
I'm Alice. You do smell good. EDWARD Alice. ALICE 
It's alright, Bella and I are going to be great friends. 
BELLA (extending her hand) And you're Jasper, right? 
JASPER Pleasure to meet you. 
But he shies away from her hand. 
ALICE (gently encouraging) You won't hurt her, Jasper. 
He isn't so sure. Edward takes Bella's hand instead. 
EDWARD I'll give you a tour of the house. 
ALICE (with meaning) I'll see you soon. 
Edward shoots Alice a look, which Bella catches before he guides her up the stairs. As they ascend, Bella takes in the eclectic ART PIECES from around the world, Ethiopian crosses, Dresden China, Asian scrolls. They reach 
THE LANDING - to FIND a wall of dozens of artistically arrayed silk squares with tassels. Bella looks closer. 
BELLA Graduation caps? 
EDWARD A private joke. We matriculate a lot. 
BELLA What a nightmare, repeating high school. 
EDWARD True, but the younger we start out in a new place, the longer we can stay there. 
She shivers at the thought of it, as they continue on.. 
85 INT. EDWARD'S ROOM - DAY 85 
EDWARD ... and this is my room. 
Bella enters to find a wall of glass doors open to a deck, with the river beyond. The rest is floor to ceiling CD's, vinyl, track tapes, etc., with a sophisticated I-pod/stereo set up. 
BELLA So you're obsessed with music. But.. (looking around) No bed? 
EDWARD No sleep. 
BELLA Ever? 
EDWARD No nightmares, no drool, no snoring. 
She considers this, as she runs a hand along a wall of CD's, studying the titles. 
EDWARD Do you have any favorites? 
-- as Jessica head-butts the ball which hits him in the face. 
ANGELA 
Oh. My. God. Angela, scanning for a shot, has frozen. Jessica and Eric SEE 
BELLA AND EDWARD -- arriving together. All eyes on campus are turning to them, filled with curiosity, jealousy, envy. BELLA Everyone's staring. EDWARD Not that guy over -- yeah, he just looked. Off his rakish, but reassuring smile.. 
CLOSE ON A GERMAN SHEPHERD 89 Moving fast, tracking. INCLUDE CHARLIE holding the leash EXT. FOREST - DAY --It's a hunting party, several dogs, half a dozen armed men. 
CHARLIE Guys, we got something 
The Deputies hurry to Charlie. They gather around A FOOTPRINT. The dogs start pulling them in a certain direction. As the posse takes off at a sprint 
UNKNOWN POV - ON CHARLIE, FROM A DISTANCE We watch Charlie and the posse move away... REVERSE to find JAMES - ATOP A KNOLL, WATCHING THEM Laurent stands next to him. Victoria jogs up. 
VICTORIA They took the bait. 
JAMES By tomorrow they'll be half way to Winnipeg. 
Victoria lasciviously grabs James' shirt. Pulls him to her. VICTORIA I love when men chase me. 
He grins, then starts taking off her clothes. They pull each other toward the woods with carnal lust. It barely registers with Laurent, who continues to watch the posse with concern. 
90 EXT./INT. FORKS COFFEE SHOP - LATE AFTERNOON 90 
Bella hurries toward the entrance, trying to keep the joy on her face in check... with minimal success. Outside the door, she passes Mike, hanging out with several of his basketball TEAMMATES. 
MIKE Yo, Arizona. So. You and Cullen. 
She shrugs, non-committal, but can't entirely hide a smile, as she hurries inside to Charlie's table and slides in. 
BELLA Sorry I'm late. Biology project. 
Cora sets a top sirloin steak in front of Charlie, and plate of seafood in front of Bella. 
CHARLIE Ordered you the seafood combo. 
BELLA Order one for yourself next time. You should cut back on the steak. 
CHARLIE I'm healthy as a horse. 
CORA 
(concerned) Say Chief, boys want to know, you find anything down by Queets River today? 
Charlie's aware of the LOGGERS at the counter listening, too. He frames his answer carefully to keep everyone calm. 
CHARLIE The suspect's moving east. Kitsap County Sheriff is taking over from here. They're putting extra guys on. 
CORA Hope they catch him fast. 
She moves off, with a measure of relief. Charlie and Bella pass each other the salt, butter for bread, etc., with an easy rhythm now. 
CHARLIE Your friends are flagging you. 
She turns to see Mike and the guys horsing around outside, straws in their noses, making faces at her. She smiles. 
CHARLIE It's okay you wanna join them. I'm just gonna turn in early anyway. 
BELLA Yeah, me, too. 
CHARLIE It's a Friday night. Go out. The Newton boy's got a big smile for you. Nice family, the Newtons. 
BELLA He's just a friend. 
CHARLIE None of the boys in town interest you? 
BELLA We're not really going to talk about boys, are we? 
CHARLIE Just... you should be around people. I leave you alone too much. 
BELLA 
(with genuine affection) I've never minded being alone. Guess I'm a lot like my dad that way. 
Charlie smiles. These two have come a long way. Cora returns 
CORA Berry cobbler, two forks. 
She sets it between them. Off them, both reaching for forks.. 
91 INT. BELLA'S ROOM - NIGHT 91 
Bella, dressed for bed, looks out the window as she talks on the phone with Rene. Bella's euphoria still lingers in her eyes.. 
BELLA So spring training's going well? 
INTERCUT WITH: 
92 INT. CAFE - NIGHT 92 
He cocks the rifle in mock-seriousness. 
BELLA Be nice, okay? He's... important. 
Charlie gives his daughter a reassuring nod... then she opens the door to REVEAL Edward in a parka and gloves. 
EDWARD Chief Swan. I wanted to formally introduce myself. I'm Edward. 
Edward extends his hand. Charlie takes it, but grunts a hello, resisting him. 
EDWARD I won't keep Bella out late tonight. We're just going to go play baseball with my family. 
CHARLIE Bella's going to play baseball? 
Bella's equally surprised, but hides it. 
EDWARD Yes, sir, that's the plan. 
CHARLIE Well. More power to you, I guess. 
EDWARD (looks him in the eyes) She'll be safe with me, sir, I promise. 
As Edward exits... Charlie holds Bella back. 
CHARLIE (sotto) You got that pepper spray? 
BELLA 
Dad. 
94 EXT. CHARLIE'S HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON 94 
Edward and Bella climb into a massive JEEP parked in the drive. 
EDWARD 
(amused) Your father thinks you should go to an all-girl's school. 
BELLA No fair, reading Charlie's mind. 
As they climb in the Jeep, Bella notices a baseball bat 
BELLA And since when do vampires like baseball? 
EDWARD It's the American pastime. Plus, there's a thunderstorm coming. It's the only time we can play. You'll see why. 
95 EXT. CLEARING IN WOODS - TWILIGHT 95 
Storm clouds gather in the sky as Bella and Edward pull up in the Jeep. She takes in a rough baseball diamond, set into an enormous field in the lap of the Olympic peaks. 
Esme and Emmett come to greet Bella. 
ESME Good thing you're here. We need a umpire. 
EMMETT (big crooked grin) She thinks we cheat. 
ESME I know you cheat. Call em as you see em, Bella. 
WHIP PAN to Alice on the Pitcher's Mound. 
ALICE It's time. 
-- Just as a deep RUMBLE of thunder shakes the forest. 
BEGIN MONTAGE - THE GAME 
And it's extraordinary. Bella stays by Esme who plays catcher. Alice pitches with lightning-fast speed. Edward and Emmett take positions in the outfield. 
-- ROSALIE SMASHES the ball with the aluminum bat. It CRACKS like thunder -- and is followed directly by real THUNDER. 
BELLA (to Esme) Now I get why you need the thunder. 
The ball SHOOTS like a meteor deep into the forest, rocketing through the trees. Edward disappears after it. 
BELLA That has to be a home run. 
ESME Edward's very fast. 
Rosalie darts around the bases, almost a blur -- Edward races out of the forest with the ball and WHIPS it to home plate. WHAP! Esme catches it a millisecond before Rosalie slides in. 
BELLA Yer out? 
Esme nods... Amazed, Bella watches as DR. CULLEN hits a line drive. Edward and Emmett race for the catch, DIVING 15 feet and COLLIDING with such might that it sounds like enormous boulders falling. They miss the ball -- Dr. Cullen is safe! 
JASPER WHACKS the next pitch -- deep into the forest. But before Edward can chase it, Alice suddenly GASPS. 
ALICE Stop! I didn't see them.. 
They all stop. Edward is immediately at Bella's side. The family instantly gathers at home plate. 
ALICE They're traveling so quickly 
(dark with disgust) I just made this his most exciting game ever. 
Bella blanches with the dawning realization of what she has just wrought up on them all as.. 
THE JEEP CAREENS DOWN THE DIRT MOUNTAIN ROAD 
A jolting, death defying ride, SPLASHING through creeks, until they reach 
97 EXT. MOUNTAIN ROAD - NIGHT 97 
THE JEEP speeds wildly down the road. 
EDWARD The first place he'll go is your house. He'll track your scent there. 
BELLA 
(horrified) What?!? Charlie's there. He's in danger because of me. Because of us! 
EDWARD 
(calmly) Then we'll lead the tracker away from him. Somehow. 
He angrily WHIPS around a bend, MUD FLYING 
98 INT. CHARLIE'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 98 
Charlie watches a baseball game on T.V. as the door suddenly BURSTS open to reveal Bella, crying, and Edward, devastated- 
BELLA I said, leave me alone! 
EDWARD Bella, don't do this. Just think about it, please 
BELLA Get out! It's over. 
She SLAMS the door. Charlie has risen, baffled, concerned. 
CHARLIE Bella? What happened? 
BELLA I have to get out of this place. Out of Forks. I'm leaving. Now. 
Bella runs upstairs. Charlie hurries after her 
99 INT. BELLA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 99 
Bella slams the door behind her. REVEAL Edward's already there, pulling things from her drawers and shoving them into a duffle faster than humanly possible. Bella leans against the door. 
BELLA (a pained whisper) I can't hurt him. 
Edward gives her a look, you have to. There's a KNOCK. 
INTERCUT Charlie on the other side. It's agony for both of them. 
CHARLIE Bells. Did he hurt you? 
BELLA No, Dad. 
CHARLIE Then what? Did he break up with you? 
BELLA I broke up with him. 
CHARLIE I thought you liked him? 
BELLA That's why I have to leave. I don't want this. I want to go home. 
EDWARD (whispering) I'll be in the truck. 
And he disappears out the window. Bella gathers strength to continue her performance. She opens the door to reveal Charlie. He follows as she carries her duffle and truck keys into 
100 INT. CHARLIE'S HOUSE - STAIRS (CONTINUOUS) - NIGHT 100 
Bella charges down the stairs -- Charlie follows. 
CHARLIE Your mother's not even in Phoenix. 
BELLA She'll come home. I'll call her from the road. 
CHARLIE You can't drive home now. I'll take you to the airport in the morning. 
BELLA I want to drive. I need time to think. I'll pull into a motel in a few hours. I promise. 
She heads down the stairs. Charlie follows.. 
101 INT. CHARLIE'S HOUSE -LIVING ROOM (CONTINUOUS) -NIGHT 101 
Bella reaches the ground floor with Charlie on her heels. She's almost to the door but Charlie blocks her. 
CHARLIE 
Bells, I know I'm not around much, 
but I can change that. We can do 
(with bloodlust) We'll rip him apart with our hands, then burn the pieces 
DR. CULLEN I don't relish killing another creature. Even a sadistic one like James. 
ROSALIE If he doesn't get to one of us first. 
BELLA 
(horrified) This is insane. You can't put yourselves in danger like this - for me. 
ROSALIE Too late. 
Edward shoots Rosalie a look, but he grabs two sets of keys off a hook, throwing one set, lightning fast, to Dr. Cullen 
EDWARD I'll run Bella south, while you lead the tracker away 
DR. CULLEN No, Edward -- the tracker thinks you won't leave Bella. He'll follow you. 
ALICE I'll go with Bella. Jasper and I will drive her south. 
(facing him) I'll keep her safe, Edward. 
Edward agonizes. Frustrated. Alice steps forward. 
EDWARD (studies her, torn) Can you keep your thoughts to yourself? 
She nods. An unspoken agreement. Edward finally surrenders his keys to Alice. Then he opens one of Bella's suitcases, pulling out clothes, tossing them to 
EDWARD Esme, Rosalie, put these on so the tracker will pick up Bella's scent. 
ROSALIE 
(dropping the clothes) Why should I? What is she to me? Just a danger you've inflicted on us 
DR. CULLEN 
(spinning on her) Rosalie. Bella is with Edward. She's a part of this family now. And we protect our family. 
She glowers, but picks up the clothes. Dr. Cullen hits the door opener and the massive METAL DOORS roll open. Dr. Cullen squeezes Edward's shoulder before he and Esme climb into the SUV. Everyone finishes loading up, climbing in cars 
Amid this, Edward and Bella take a moment together. 
BELLA If any of you get hurt because of me 
EDWARD We won't, there are five of us, two of them. When it's done, I'll come get you. 
He pulls her closer, looking into her eyes. 
EDWARD You're my life now. 
They drink each other in, possibly for the last time... as the SUV PEELS out, WIPING THE FRAME 
107 EXT. HIGHWAY, PACIFIC NORTHWEST - DAWN 107 
The sun begins to rise on the empty road as a sleek, black MERCEDES SEDAN with dark tinted windows BLASTS through frame 
108 INT. MERCEDES - SAME 108 
Jasper drives, Alice in the passenger seat. Bella is in the back, her eyes red from crying. She talks on her cell phone 
BELLA 
Mom, it's me again. You must have 
let your phone die. Anyway, I'm 
not in Forks anymore but I'm okay. 
I'll explain when you call. 
She hangs up, then faces back out the window, watching the green, misty Olympic Peninsula speed past. Off Bella's face - 
A SERIES OF DISSOLVES THROUGHOUT THE DAY, THEN THE NIGHT 
-- show us the landscape as it changes from dark green forests to stretches of grassy hillsides, to drier, browner surroundings, until night falls and headlights lights flash by us. Finally, we land in.. 
109 OMITTED 109 
110 EXT. FOREST, OLYMPIC PENINSULA - DAY 110 
TREES BLOW PAST US at a blinding speed as we track Edward, Rosalie, and Emmett who dart in and out of frame, blasting through the misty woods, Edward, the fastest, in the lead. 
Edward stops, trying to read his enemy's thoughts. Rosalie tears a tiny swatch of her shirt, leaves it on a FLOWERING MAPLE TREE. And then they're gone. 
111 OMITTED 111 
112 EXT. ANOTHER PART OF THE WOODS - DAY 112 
Esme and Dr. Cullen crouch atop a hill, looking down at the river. In the distance, below, they SEE 
THEIR POV - ON THE LAKE - VICTORIA jogs into view. She then looks in their direction. Once Dr. Cullen and Esme are assured she has their scent, they continue over the hill's crest. 
BELLA No... we can't. (then) When will you get here? 
EDWARD In a couple hours. Then you and I will go somewhere. Together. The others will keep hunting. 
(then, determined) Bella, I swear to you, I'll do whatever it takes to make you safe again. 
Off Bella, her eyes welling.. 
118 EXT. SCOTTSDALE HOTEL - DAY 118 
SEE Alice in the lobby, settling the bill. Jasper loads up the car out front. 
119 INT. SCOTTSDALE HOTEL - BEDROOM - DAY 119 
Bella gathers her things, then her phone RINGS again. 
INSERT CALLER I.D. -It reads HOME. Bella answers - 
BELLA Mom, I'm so glad you got my - 
RENE (O.S. (panicked) Bella? Bella? Where are you? 
BELLA Calm down, Mom. Everything is fine, okay? I'll explain every 
HEAR RUSTLING on the line, as if Rene dropped the phone. 
BELLA ... Mom? Are you there? 
Then Bella HEARS a voice that sends a chill down her spine 
JAMES (O.S. Nice house you have here. Not the best on the block, but comfortable. 
INTERCUT WITH: 
120 INT. RENE'S HOUSE, PHOENIX - DAY 120 
VERY CLOSE ON JAMES, his sinister eyes and vicious smile. 
JAMES I was prepared to wait for you. But then Mom came home after she received a very worried call from your Dad. It all worked out quite well. 
Bella's eyes are wild with fear. 
JAMES I must say, Forks High School doesn't protect its students' privacy very well. It was just too easy for Victoria to find your previous address. 
RENE (O.S. Bella? Bella?.. 
BELLA Leave my mother out of this. 
JAMES You're protective of her. That's nice. You can still save her. But you'll need to get away from your friends. Can you do that? 
BELLA I... don't think so. 
JAMES If your mother's life depends on it? 
Bella is terrified, but there's no choice here. 
BELLA Where should I meet you? 
James grins as he fingers a PHOTO of Bella that's attached to the refrigerator with a magnet. It's the same photo Charlie has of her, age 7, in a tutu, sitting on the floor. 
JAMES The old ballet studio around the corner. And I'll know if you bring anyone along. Poor mommy would pay the price for that mistake. 
(sniffs the air) She smells like you. Delicious. 
STAY ON BELLA as she hangs up, panicked. She starts flinging open drawers, searching for a weapon - a pen, a sewing kit. Useless. Then she remembers.. 
Her purse. She dumps out the contents, and FINDS the pepper spray Charlie gave her. She clings to it, her only protection now. 
121 OMITTED 121 
122 OMITTED 122

127 INT./EXT. SCOTTSDALE HOTEL - TWILIGHT - DRIVING 127 
Bella walks through the lobby, scanning for Jasper and Alice. She spots them outside under the porte cacher, loading the Mercedes, deep in a heated discussion. She slips out the opposite door, rushes toward a Taxi and jumps in, closes the door. The DRIVER is an elderly woman with a hacking COUGH. 
BELLA (taking a breath for courage) 8th and Palo Verde, please. 
The taxi pulls out. Bella watches the hotel disappear. Off her FACE IN THE REAR WINDOW.. 
BELLA (V.O. 
I've never given much thought to 
Amused, he flings her across the floor like a bowling ball. She SMASHES hard into a mirrored column. James captures it on film. 
JAMES Beautiful! Very visually dynamic. I chose my stage well. 
He advances toward her. 
JAMES Still stubborn, aren't you? Is that what makes you special? Because frankly, I don't see it. 
He inhales as if he can taste her already 
JAMES Too bad he didn't have the strength to turn you. Instead, he kept you this fragile little human. It's cruel, really. 
James flips on the camera, but the lens is coated with pepper spray. He tries to wipe it off. 
JAMES Well done! You've succeeded in annoying me. 
He STOMPS on her shin! HEAR her tibia SNAP! Bella SCREAMS in agony. 
JAMES Tell Edward how much it hurts. 
Abruptly, the camera is in her face 
JAMES Tell him to avenge you. 
BELLA No! Edward, don't.. 
James inhales as her blood pools. He leans in, hungry. Bella, half-conscious, watches him turn the camera on his own face 
VIDEO CAMERA'S POV - ECU ON JAMES' FACE 
JAMES Cut! The end. 
Suddenly -- JAMES IS KNOCKED OUT OF FRAME! 
He rises to find himself face to face with Edward. James CHARGES Edward, forcing him up against a column. 
JAMES You're alone... because you're faster than the others. But not stronger. 
James SMASHES Edward's face into the mirror until it cracks. 
EDWARD I'm strong enough to kill you. 
Edward FLINGS James backwards -- SMASHING through a freestanding mirror -- into the doorway. He scoops Bella up and leaps toward the balcony exit door -- when suddenly he and Bella are JERKED downward. 
James YANKS Edward violently onto the floor -- KNOCKING Bella out of his arms -- as James FLINGS Edward up into the top window -- EMBEDDING him in the casement and bricks. 
James crouches beside Bella. He grabs her HAND 
Looking directly at Edward with a sinister grin -- he SINKS HIS TEETH into Bella's hand! She SCREAMS in agony. 
Edward's rage ERUPTS -- he climbs out of the window casement and SUICIDE-DIVE-BOMBS James, savagely PLOWING him through the floorboards. 
ON BELLA -- as the venom travels through her veins. 
BELLA'S POV - dark figures twist and fight, in and out of focus. 
Her eyes suddenly POP OPEN to see the EXPLOSIVE RAW REALITY of James KICKING Edward, delivering death blows when - 
Suddenly Edward's hand SHOOTS UP and GRABS James' ankle. Edward ROARS up to his feet and SWINGS James around like a baseball bat, SMASHING him into mirror after mirror. 
James is battered, beaten. Bella moans -- and the sound of her pain slices through Edward. In an animalistic fury, Edward BITES OFF a piece of James' flesh .. 
WHIP PAN from Bella's horrified face to DR. CULLEN --now standing beside Edward, placing a hand on his son's shoulder. 
Edward turns to see his father -- and EMMETT, JASPER, and ALICE, dropping down from the balcony. 
Edward's expression changes --he realizes he's gone too far. He backs off as his siblings crouch into attack mode and LUNGE at James like a pack of animals. 
Dr. Cullen rushes to the injured Bella who SCREAMS again in pain. Edward dashes toward her - 
BELLA'S POV -ON THE THREE CULLEN SIBLINGS, going in and out of focus... it almost looks like a tribal dance as they rip out the floorboards and build a fire ... it's like a funeral pyre as they rip James apart, throwing limbs into the fire.. 
BACK ON BELLA -- as Edward reaches her side. Dr. Cullen works fast to assess her wounds, focusing on a massive bleed from her leg. But clearly her hand hurts the most. She writhes in pain. 
INTERCUT BELLA'S DISORIENTED POV WITH THE CHAOTIC REALITY: 
Dr. Cullen applies pressure to the gash on her thigh - 
DR. CULLEN Her femoral artery's been severed. She's losing too much blood 
BELLA It's on fire! My hand! 
EDWARD Venom - 
DR. CULLEN 
(working on Bella) 
You have to make a choice. Either 
let the change happen 
(lowering her voice) I think that boy is in love with you. 
Bella smiles. Rene grins. Bella glances at Edward. 
BELLA Um, Mom, would you mind getting Dad? I want to talk to him. Apologize. 
RENE I'm sure he doesn't care about that, Baby. But Ill go get him. 
Rene kisses Bella's forehead. Exits. Bella watches her go. The door shutting behind her. Bella turns back to find Edward standing next to her with deep concern. Her eyes well. He kisses her forehead soothingly. 
BELLA Is James - did you -- 
EDWARD We took care of him. And the woman, Victoria, she ran off. 
She closes her eyes with relief, then looks at him. 
BELLA I'm alive because of you. 
EDWARD (darkens) You're in here because of me. 
Her wounds cause him pain. He strokes her face. 
EDWARD The worst of it... was thinking I couldn't stop - 
BELLA But you did. 
EDWARD Bella, you should go to Jacksonville. Where I can't hurt you anymore.. 
BELLA What? No! I want to be with you! I don't want 
EDWARD 
(sitting next to her) Sssh. It's alright. I'm not going anywhere. I'm right here.. 
He wraps an arm around her. As she curls up in his arms.. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
135 EXT. FORKS, WASHINGTON - LATE AFTERNOON 135 
An AERIAL SWEEP over the lush green forests. We're back in the misty, damp beauty of the Pacific Northwest.. 
136 EXT. CHARLIE'S HOUSE - BEAUTIFUL LATE AFTERNOON 136 
At a picnic table, Charlie cleans a fish with a big knife. Edward waits awkwardly near his Volvo, dressed in an elegant suit. But even calm Edward is unnerved by Charlie's glare. The front door opens and they look up to see 
BELLA --framed in the doorway in a stunning long dress. Edward is enchanted. Bella descends the steps with difficulty, due to her LEG CAST. Charlie edges out Edward to help her down. 
BELLA 
Alice lent me the dress. It was the 
only thing that would fit over my 
cast. Is it too... 
EDWARD 
You're perfect... I'll take good 
care of her, Chief. 
CHARLIE Heard that before. 
Edward moves to open the car door. Charlie holds Bella back. 
CHARLIE (sotto) I put new pepper spray in your bag. 
BELLA 
Dad. 
CHARLIE ... and... you look beautiful. 
Father and daughter share a smile.. 
137 EXT./INT. MANSION, VIEW POINT INN - TWILIGHT 137 
Edward's Volvo pulls up to this lovely inn. He helps Bella out of the car, and begins to guide her through the dining room. Mr. Molina and other teachers are there. We may notice the back of a Redhead, mingling with the chaperones. 
BELLA 
I can't believe you're making me do 
this. 
He just grins. Edward guides her around a corner to.. 
138 EXT. MANSION BACKYARD (CONTINUOUS) - TWILIGHT 138 
THE PROM - Monte Carlo style. Gaming tables and roulette wheels. Guys in tuxes and girls in gowns gamble for prizes, dance and socialize.
