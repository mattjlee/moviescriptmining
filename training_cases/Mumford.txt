"MUMFORD" 
Screenplay by 
Lawrence Kasdan 
SHOOTING DRAFT 
EXT. MAIN STREET, SMALL TOWN - DAY 
A freight truck of late 1950's vintage pulls to the side of the road in a small rural town. A handsome, well-built man gets out of the passenger side and thanks the Driver. THE NEWCOMER carries his coat over his shoulder and a beat-up suitcase; he's got a jut jaw and a modified pompadour, his shirtsleeves are rolled all the way up past his biceps. He wipes his brow against the sweltering heat and looks around. [Until noted below, this section of the movie is in BLACK & WHITE.] 
FOLLETT (V.O.) I get outta the truck in this two- bit town. I got no money and no prospects. What I need right now is a stiff drink, a cold shower, and a hot broad. I'll take 'em in any order they come... 
EXT. BOARDING HOUSE - DAY 
Old three story gothic house in ill-repair beyond a peeling picket fence and a scruffy yard. The sign says -- ROOMS TO RENT. The Newcomer goes in the gate. 
FOLLETT (V.O.) ...Oh yeah, one other thing I need -- an angle. 
He squints through the dirty screen door but sees nothing, then knocks and turns away to survey the neighborhood. 
FOLLETT (V.O.) I was thinking -- if it weren't for bad luck, I wouldn't have any luck at all... 
LANDLADY (O.S.) Can I help you? 
The Newcomer turns toward the door. Standing there, holding the screen open, is the LANDLADY. She's a knockout in a cheap, small-town way: a cotton dress that buttons down the front and clings with sweat to her generous curves. 
FOLLETT (V.O.) Either my luck had just changed, or Fate just bought me another round of trouble. 
INT. BOARDING HOUSE - DAY 
The Newcomer's POV of the Landlady as she leads him up the narrow, gloomy stairs from the second floor to the third story / attic. She has a Monroe-like sway to her walk. We can barely HEAR her DISTANT, ECHOEY DIALOGUE: 
LANDLADY ...not very fancy... house needs repairs... We haven't had a man around here for so long... 
FOLLETT (V.O.) She kept yammerin' the whole time, but her hips were doing all the talking... 
The Landlady reaches the tiny landing at the top of the stairs and opens a door to a squalid room with a bed, bureau and tiny window. The Newcomer has to squeeze by her voluptuous body to get inside and look around. It doesn't take long. His gaze returns to the Landlady who is leaning against the door, chest thrust forward. He focusses on her fingers, toying with the button at her sweat-shiny cleavage. 
FOLLETT (V.O.) It couldn't 'a been any clearer what the set-up was. The next move was up to me... 
The Newcomer takes a step in the Landlady's direction -- 
MUMFORD (V.O.) Don't tell me! 
INT. MUMFORD'S OFFICE - (PRESENT) DAY 
CLOSE-UP of MUMFORD wincing. 
MUMFORD (softer) -- That's all the time we have. Sorry... (indicates his watch) ...next time. 
We see Mumford's office: the office of a Psychologist, a therapist with a doctorate. It's modest, comfortable, neat, with a calm, relaxed ambience. [The movie is now in COLOR.] His patient, HENRY FOLLETT, looks nothing like The Newcomer in the soft-core fantasy he's been narrating. Instead, he's a mild-looking pharmacist with glasses and a receding hairline. Only the voice is the same; it's as studly as his fantasy alter-ego. Follett has been lying on a couch, but now has twisted with some irritation to look at Mumford. 
FOLLETT I have eighteen more minutes! 
MUMFORD I don't want to hear any more today. 
FOLLETT Why not? 
MUMFORD Mr. Follett, do you trust me or don't you? 
FOLLETT Well, I don't know... I only been seeing you -- 
MUMFORD Without trust, there's no point to any of this. You might as well not come. 
FOLLETT Now hold on, I didn't say I didn't want to come -- 
MUMFORD Good, then go. 
INT. LILY'S CAFÉ- DAY 
Lunch crowd. Mumford can be seen out the big front window, crossing from the two-story building that houses his office on the main drag of this small town which, oddly enough, is also called Mumford. He comes inside and goes to the counter to pick up some take-out. The Proprietor is a woman around forty named LILY, who talks to him as she works. 
LILY You're early... it's not ready. What happened? 
MUMFORD My patient had to leave early. 
LIONEL Kind of impatient for a big-time headshrinker, aren't you? How 'bout you let me explain it my own way... 
As Lionel goes on, Mumford's eyes again dart toward -- THE CLOCK: still 2:23! Hold on it. Finally, it moves. Mumford's eyes dart toward his desk -- 
A deadly-looking letter opener in the shape of Excalibur stands GLINTING LIGHT in a marble rendition of Arthur's stone. 
LIONEL ...and in the dream, it's always the same, I wake up in my room from when I was I kid in Ohio, and I realize this is the day of the big exam at school... 
Mumford's head rocks slowly back for a moment as if he's going to drift off. He snaps back to life and stares hard at the top of Lionel's head, where there is a bald spot starting to take hold. The sound of LIONEL'S VOICE begins to echo -- 
LIONEL ...which is no problem for me, because I remembered it was coming and I've attended every class, so I'm totally prepared. Then I see myself running down the hall at school... 
MUMFORD'S GLANCE FLASHPANS from Lionel's bald spot to the gleaming letter opener. 
Mumford closes his eyes. We CUT TO: 
INT. HIGH SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY 
A boy, unmistakably the Young Lionel, runs down the deserted hallway toward a bright doorway. [LIONEL'S DREAM has a BLUE TINT.] 
LIONEL (V.O.) ...but it's not really my school -- and this is very interesting -- it's the school from the next district -- 
MUMFORD (V.O.) -- Go on! 
INT. HIGH SCHOOL CLASSROOM - DAY 
Young Lionel comes breathlessly in the classroom door and stares alarmed. 
LIONEL (V.O.) And even though I arrive a little bit early, everybody's already there. But the surprising part is -- 
WHAT YOUNG LIONEL SEES: Everyone in the class, including the Teacher in the front, is naked. The Teacher holds out an exam toward Young Lionel. 
LIONEL (V.O.) -- I'm the only one who's prepared! 
CUT TO: 
INT. WAITING ROOM, MUMFORD'S OFFICE - DAY 
ALTHEA BROCKETT, a woman in her forties, sits on the couch reading a mail order catalogue for home furnishings. There are several other catalogues sticking out of her jammed, woven carry-all. 
The door to Mumford's inner office opens with some force. Mumford stands looking back across his office at Lionel, who is getting up from the couch in some confusion. 
LIONEL -- you crazy? You can't do this! 
MUMFORD Sure I can, Lionel. 
LIONEL I'm a criminal lawyer -- you think I like my clients? I can't stand most of them! But I don't kick them out... 
MUMFORD See that sign -- We retain the right to refuse service to anyone. I'm not going to charge you for this session, but I don't want to see you back here. 
Lionel looks around, but there is no such sign. He does spot Althea watching the show from the couch. 
LIONEL Don't you at least have a back door I can use? 
MUMFORD Come out this way. There's no shame in getting a little therapy... is there, Althea? 
Althea stands up, smiling. She thinks Mumford is the bee's knees. 
ALTHEA Not at all. It takes guts, Lionel. 
Lionel steams by them in a black mood. 
LIONEL Maybe some of us don't need this crap! 
MUMFORD And it's the Hubble Telescope, not the Himball Telescope. 
Lionel bangs out the front door. Mumford motions Althea inside -- 
MUMFORD Jeez... what an asshole. 
Althea heads inside, giggling wildly. She can't get enough of this guy. 
INT. MUMFORD'S OFFICE -DAY 
Althea is sobbing. Mumford hands her a new Kleenex from the box next to the couch. She wads it with her current one and tries to stop crying. Mumford settles back in his chair, patient. 
ALTHEA What do they want from me? (more sobbing) What have I done that's so wrong? (pulling it together) They act as though they don't have their own peculiar things... They do! Believe me. Everybody's got something... (looks at Mumford) Even you probably have things. 
MUMFORD No... a little. There's a lot of debate about it. 
COOK Yeah, I got that. Some people think it's all in their heads. (more intense) It's been so bad she's had to move back here to Mumford and live with us. And I'm not sure that's the best thing, either... 
MUMFORD Why's that? 
COOK Oh... a lot of things. Several different factors. Will you see her, Doctor Mumford? 
MUMFORD Sure. Why don't you bring her up to my office at 3 tomorrow afternoon. 
Cook nods, but looks worried. 
COOK I'm not sure she'll come. She's in a mood. Do you ever go to somebody's house? 
MUMFORD Generally that doesn't work out so well. It sends the wrong message to people who need to make a change. 
Cook is quick to agree; he doesn't want to make waves. But he's worried. 
EXT. MAIN STREET - DAY 
Mumford is walking up the busy sidewalk carrying his new 5- foot stepladder hooked on his shoulder. Folks greet him. Suddenly Lionel appears in front of Mumford, who stops. 
MUMFORD Hello, Lionel. 
LIONEL You've got to have the right ladder for the job. You don't know what you're doing, you can get yourself in trouble. 
MUMFORD You're right, as usual. See you. 
Mumford continues up the street. We STAY WITH Lionel, who watches Mumford with a sour look, then turns to enter a small medical building. 
INT. DR. DELBANCO'S OFFICE - DAY 
DR. ERNEST DELBANCO, a middle-aged psychiatrist with longish, vanity hair, and PHYLLIS SHEELER, a psychologist in her thirties, sit on the doctor's comfortable furniture, listening. The remains of their take-out lunch is on the coffee table. They seem a little impatient with their as-yet- unseen visitor -- 
LIONEL (O.S.) ...completely inappropriate and highly unprofessional. Now I don't want to presume to tell you how to run your businesses -- 
SHEELER -- practices. 
Lionel is sitting across the room, making an ardent case -- 
LIONEL -- Whatever. Six months ago, you two were the only games in town. The value of your... (mocking) ..."practices" could be seriously undermined by this bozo. A town this size has only so many headcases to go around. 
DELBANCO What exactly would you have us do, Lionel? 
LIONEL Protect your turf! Check this guy out. I smell a rat, I tell you. 
Delbanco and Sheeler exchange a look; they find Lionel distasteful. 
SHEELER Mr. Dillard, I'm sure Dr. Delbanco shares my gratitude for your concern. But I also know he'd agree that you misunderstand the nature of our calling to mental health. We're not in some... widget business, trying to crush our competition. 
LIONEL What the hell's a widget? 
INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE DR. DELBANCO'S OFFICE - DAY 
Lionel comes out of the office, miffed, and goes down the stairs. A moment later, the door opens slightly and Delbanco peeks out to make sure Lionel is gone. He closes the door on us. 
INT. DR. DELBANCO'S OFFICE - DAY 
Delbanco stands at the door looking across the room at Sheeler. 
DELBANCO What an asshole! 
SHEELER (agrees) Ernest, what do you think? 
DELBANCO I think he's got a point. 
So does she. 
EXT. BASEBALL DIAMOND - DAY 
Idyllic. The beautifully manicured field is surrounded by lush woods. Standing about forty feet apart, Mumford and Skip are alone on the field throwing a baseball back and forth. For quite a while the only sounds are the birds, the wind, and the regular SLAP of ball into glove. Finally -- 
SKIP This is great! 
SLAP... SLAP. 
SKIP This is exactly what I wanted. 
INT. MUMFORD'S OFFICE - DAY 
Silence. Nessa sits staring at Mumford defiantly, an unlit cigarette in her mouth. Mumford looks at the clock -- 3:00 -- and stands up, session over. Nessa quickly lights her cigarette with the lighter concealed in her hand and stands up too. She exhales a huge cloud of smoke and walks quickly to the back door of the office, which Mumford has opened for her, and goes out. 
Mumford waves half-heartedly at the cloud of smoke as he walks to the door to the waiting room and opens it. 
MUMFORD'S POV: As the door swings open, the first figure we see is Mr. Cook; he twists around at the sound of the door. He acknowledges Mumford and then sighs as he steps aside to reveal, sitting exhausted in a chair, his daughter -- 
SOFIE -- a young woman whose actual appearance is somewhat disguised at present by her wan, ashen visage. She regards Mumford with some resignation. Her father helps her out of the chair. Sofie keeps her eyes on Mumford. 
CLOSE ON Mumford, watching her. 
INT. MUMFORD'S OFFICE - DAY 
LATER. Mr. Cook is gone. Sofie is sitting up on the couch, facing Mumford. She looks like she might pass out at any moment, but her voice is stronger than you'd expect. 
MUMFORD Feel free to lie down. Most people do. 
SOFIE I'd better not, I'll fall right to sleep. I think it's too soon for me to be sleeping with you. 
A joke. Mumford smiles. 
MUMFORD What can you tell me about this? 
SOFIE Oh, lord. It's almost too exhausting to tell you... (tiny smile, to herself) ...about my exhaustion. I didn't really want to come. I'm not hopeful right now. But I couldn't take the look on my dad's face. He's a truly kind person, which is pretty extraordinary if you knew the story. He's the opposite of me, I guess -- all stamina and resolve. 
It's taken all her energy to say this and she sinks down a bit into the couch. 
MUMFORD When did you start to feel this way? 
SOFIE About six months ago, I guess it is now. God, it seems like years. What a bore! I'm embarrassed by it. Before this happened -- when I'd hear people talk about this kind of thing -- I thought it was a bunch of bullshit. 
She sees something in his face and suddenly laughs -- it's a weak but magical sound. 
MUMFORD What? 
SOFIE You think that now! You think it's a bunch of hooey, don't you? 
MUMFORD (unconvincing) No. 
SOFIE I saw it. I saw it in your eyes. 
Mumford is knocked off balance -- she's right. She saw him clearly. 
SOFIE That's okay. Maybe it is. My mother always says -- "Everything that's wrong with you is in your head." I suppose that's true. 
MUMFORD Back when this started, was there anything unusual happening in your life? A change of job, of living situation... a loss of some kind? 
SOFIE No... but it started one year to the day after my divorce became final. That's not too suspicious, is it?... But it wasn't like I was feeling bad about the divorce. Just the opposite. 
MUMFORD Hmm. 
SOFIE Hmm? Is that a professional opinion? 
MUMFORD Hmm, as in -- that's interesting. Sometimes, with enough clues, it's possible to figure these things out. 
SOFIE Even if you don't think it's real? 
MUMFORD I don't know what's real and what isn't. That's never been my strong suit. But if you're tired all the time and you've had to give up the life you were having and come back home when you didn't want to... that's worth trying to fix. Maybe I can help you do that. 
SOFIE What would you do? 
MUMFORD We... we would try several things. But I need to see you a lot. 
SOFIE I don't know. I barely made it today. 
MUMFORD I'll come to you. We'll try a little walking. 
Sofie suddenly looks defeated. 
MUMFORD We'll take it slow. You'll never feel you can't handle it. 
SOFIE I don't think I can afford it. I don't want my dad paying. 
MUMFORD We'll work it out. 
Sofie gives him a long look. 
LATER. Dinner is over. Jeremy comes out onto the veranda carrying two Cuban cigars. His casual outfit is as stylish and pricey as his work outfit. He joins Mumford and Althea, who immediately gets up. 
ALTHEA I'll be back. 
She goes inside. The men each have a snifter of cognac. Jeremy makes a ceremony of cutting the cigars -- 
JEREMY I think you'll like this. Know much about Cuban cigars? 
MUMFORD Nope. 
Jeremy puts the cigars down, pulls a joint out of his cashmere pullover and fires it up. After exhaling a huge cloud of smoke, he offers the joint to Mumford, who declines. 
JEREMY Makes the whole thing that much better. 
Jeremy takes another hit on the joint and puts it down. He gives a cigar and his gold lighter to Mumford, who begins to light up -- 
JEREMY Just hold the flame a little bit below the end... that's it... now just turn it slowly as you draw... 
Mumford does as he's told. Jeremy lights his own cigar. 
JEREMY Are you a man who likes to treat himself right? 
MUMFORD I've had my moments. 
JEREMY I am. And I'm not ashamed of it. Nobody ever said on their death bed -- "I treated myself too well." 
MUMFORD I thought it was -- Nobody ever said, "I should have spent more time at the office." 
JEREMY Fill in the blank. I don't mind the office. The point is, you only go 'round once. Like the Zens say -- Be here now. 
MUMFORD What do you do? 
JEREMY Althea hasn't told you? 
MUMFORD (no) We've been talking about her, mostly. 
JEREMY Well, in '85 four of us left our firms and formed an investment banking venture. We've got twenty-three people working there now. 
MUMFORD You've done well. 
The marijuana is kicking in now -- Jeremy gets a self- satisfied, condescending look on his face that no straight mind would dare. His response includes their lavish immediate surroundings-- 
JEREMY We've done... very well. You know anything about addiction, Doc? 
MUMFORD A little. 
JEREMY Well, I'm addicted to winning. I say when you're in the red zone, you gotta score. (watches Mumford smoke) So what do you think? 
MUMFORD Tastes good. 
JEREMY No... I mean about Althea. About her... (makes a face) ...behavior. Do you think you can fix her up? 
MUMFORD What do you think's wrong with her? 
JEREMY She's gone weird is what's wrong with her. Out of control. Probably from living out here in Mayberry. 
Jeremy blows cigar smoke into his snifter, then takes a mouthful of cognac, savoring the sensations. Mumford watches, fascinated by this guy. 
JEREMY You're the doctor, what do you think? 
MUMFORD She seems very unhappy. 
Jeremy gives him a look, as if to say "duh." 
JEREMY I think we all knew that, professor. The question... the real -- (drawn out, stoned) -- quest-tio-nee... is... why? 
Mumford looks at him a long time. 
EXT. ROAD INTO MUMFORD - NIGHT 
Jeremy Brockett's Mercedes 500 SL whips around a curve. 
INT. BROCKETT'S MERCEDES - NIGHT 
Martin is driving Mumford back to town. 
MARTIN But you know how to drive? 
Mumford is hunched over the computer, reading avidly. His printer is churning out hard copies. 
EXT. FRONT PORCH, COOK HOUSE - DAY 
Mumford comes out the front door and holds it open for Sofie. He offers his arm and she takes it tentatively. 
SOFIE I'm not making any promises. 
MUMFORD We'll turn back anytime you want. 
SOFIE (seeing something) Oh boy... this should be interesting. 
Mumford looks out toward the street. A woman in her fifties is turning into the front walk. She stares at them, unsmiling, as the two parties converge. She is MRS. COOK. 
SOFIE Hello, Mother. I want you to meet Dr. Mumford. 
MRS. COOK Mumford... like the town? 
MUMFORD (offering his hand) Yes. It's nice to meet you, Mrs. Cook. 
She finally takes his hand, but it's not friendly. 
MRS. COOK What's happening here? 
SOFIE We're going for a walk. 
MRS. COOK Do you think that's a good idea? 
SOFIE Dr. Mumford does, yes. I've put myself completely in his hands. For today, anyway. 
MRS. COOK What kind of doctor are you? 
MUMFORD Ph.D., psychologist. 
MRS. COOK Oh... not a real doctor. 
MUMFORD That's right, the fake kind. 
Mrs. Cook is not amused. Sofie pulls on Mumford. 
SOFIE We'd better go or I'm liable to bail on the whole thing. 
Mrs. Cook steps aside as they move up the walk. 
EXT. SIDEWALK, NEAR THE COOK HOUSE - DAY 
Mumford and Sofie, foreground, walk slowly up the block. In the background, Mrs. Cook watches for awhile before going inside. 
SOFIE Mom's such a cutie. 
MUMFORD People usually have to get to know me before they hate me. 
SOFIE She's not in a bad mood. She's like that all the time. (a beat) It doesn't bother me anymore. It's my dad and my brother I worry about. 
MUMFORD Maybe... but you're the one whose ass is dragging. 
SOFIE (laughs) Is that the technical description of what I've got? 
MUMFORD Is she against you getting help? 
SOFIE We don't discuss it. 
MUMFORD Something's bothering her. 
SOFIE Oh, we've all disappointed her. Me, especially, but Dad, of course. She thinks my brother's all right, but she didn't expect much. It's what happens when you "marry beneath yourself"... 
Sofie suddenly seems to be fading. 
MUMFORD Please... forgive me. 
SOFIE What? 
MUMFORD Negative thinking makes everything more difficult. If you're going to have enough strength to do this, we have to talk only about positive things. All right? 
She looks at him, unsure if he's serious. It seems so corny. But she agrees. 
MUMFORD Okay then... Are you positive your mother's a bitch? (she laughs, surprised) Just kidding. 
Sofie's not sure how to take that. She looks away. 
MUMFORD There... I've given myself a real whopper. 
SOFIE You actually address yourself by name in your thoughts? (Mumford laughs) So you really think having two opposing ideas in your head does some kind of damage? 
MUMFORD Sometimes, yeah... pulling in two different directions at once. It makes tiny little tears in our fabric. 
SOFIE Well then, my life has been some kind of huge rip. 
INT. BOARDING HOUSE (IN HENRY FOLLETT'S FANTASY) - DAY 
The handsome Newcomer of Follett's fantasy comes down the steps from the attic wearing a sleeveless undershirt, towel thrown over his shoulder. He goes into the bathroom off the second floor hall and begins to wash up. [Again, Follett's fantasy world is in BLACK & WHITE.] 
FOLLETT (V.O.) The town was a rube's heaven, but I found work my first day out down at Old Man Sutter's gas station and diner. I knew his stacked young wife was going to be a problem, but, hey, life is full of problems. Back at the boarding house, I was washing up when I heard a load of yellin' and -- 
IN THE BATHROOM MIRROR, the Newcomer's POV: a nubile teenager, 17 going on 35, in a tight cheerleader's outfit, comes up the stairs and stops at the top to turn and yell back down at her mother. Her dialogue distant and echoey: 
LANDLADY'S DAUGHTER ...get off my case! You don't like any of my friends... 
FOLLETT (V.O.) ...I got my first look at the landlady's daughter. 
The LANDLADY'S DAUGHTER looks up and sees the Newcomer watching her through the half-open bathroom door. She gives him a petulant, white-hot look, then turns on her heel and goes into her room at that end of the hall. She bangs her door behind her, but it bounces open again about a foot. The Newcomer, still watching in the bathroom mirror, now has a view of the bureau mirror in the Landlady's Daughter's room. In there, seemingly oblivious, the girl quickly strips off the top of her outfit, revealing a '50's-era white bra. 
FOLLETT (V.O.) Lucky for me, she was plenty upset but not too careful. 
Suddenly, in mirror reflection of mirror, the Landlady's Daughter meets the Newcomer's smoldering stare and her lip begins to curl. 
FOLLETT (V.O.) Or maybe it wasn't an accident at all -- 
MUMFORD (V.O.) Mr. Follett. 
FOLLETT (V.O.) -- 'cause in that instant I saw the beginning of a vixen's smile and I knew -- 
MUMFORD (V.O.) Henry! 
Mysteriously, the door to the girl's bedroom slams shut, cutting off the Newcomer's view. He looks with surprise into his mirror -- it suddenly shatters. 
INT. MUMFORD'S OFFICE - DAY 
Follett sits up abruptly on the couch and twists toward Mumford, agitated. 
FOLLETT What? 
MUMFORD Stop now. 
FOLLETT Why? I'm paying for this. 
MUMFORD Not for this. Not me, you're not. 
FOLLETT (challenging) You find it distasteful, don't you? 
MUMFORD It doesn't matter how I feel about it. It's how you feel about it that matters. 
FOLLETT I enjoy it. Does that make me some kind of pervert? Just because a man has a rich imaginative life -- 
MUMFORD You didn't come to me because you have a rich imagination. 
FOLLETT No? 
MUMFORD You came because it's taking over. You're in its grip. 
FOLLETT I never said that. 
Mumford's tone suddenly picks up a touch of steel. 
MUMFORD Where's your wife, Henry? 
Follett flinches, settles back down onto the couch, sulking. 
MUMFORD Where's your wife, Henry? 
FOLLETT Go to hell. 
MUMFORD (softer) I didn't hear you. 
Follett mutters something to himself, then is silent until -- 
Skip closes his eyes for a second and gathers himself. 
SKIP All right, I'm just gonna tell you, as simple and direct as I can. (one last spasm of doubt) And you understand that this is a big secret? Just between us? (Mumford does) Okay. You know I've got this gift for certain kinds of... machines. 
MUMFORD You are Panda, monarch of modems. 
SKIP That's right. And you also know that even though I make 23% of the modems in the world... I cannot make one simple connection with any woman who could truly love me. 
MUMFORD Okay... let's say that, for now. 
SKIP It's true, believe me. So... do you know what I've been doing, all alone, in my workshop, for almost two years?... Mr. Find-the-Need-and-Fill- It. How I spend my every solitary hour? 
Mumford shakes his head, "no." 
SKIP Guess. (Mumford demurs) Go ahead, guess! 
MUMFORD (if he must) Jerking off? 
SKIP No!... Although that's a good guess. No, what I've been working on, what the world really needs and no one has been able to create -- (leans in, whispering) -- a virtually life-like, humanoid, gender-specific, anatomically functional... sexual surrogate slash companion. 
Mumford tries to put that all together. Finally -- 
MUMFORD Slash what? 
SKIP Sexual surrogate... slash... companion. 
MUMFORD A doll? 
SKIP No, Doc, not a doll. I am Panda. I'm talking about much, much more than a doll. The world has never seen what I'm talking about... except maybe in the movies. 
Mumford considers that a long time, watching as the sun finally sinks below the horizon. He looks back at Skip. 
MUMFORD How's it coming? 
SKIP You don't think I'm insane? 
MUMFORD ("no") And that's your secret? (Skip: "yes") You meant -- like a trade secret? 
SKIP No, Doc, a private secret! It's perverted, it's pitiful. What am I -- Dr. Frankenstein? Aren't you repulsed? 
MUMFORD Sounds like kind of a good idea. 
SKIP (nonplussed) Really? 
MUMFORD Definitely. 
It's getting dark fast now. Mumford reaches into his bag and takes out the headlamp we saw earlier. He fits the straps carefully over his head. 
MUMFORD Skip, that's not much of a secret. 
SKIP (hurt) It's not? 
MUMFORD Oh, it's okay. It's just not something to be ashamed of. Maybe you don't want people knowing -- and believe me, it's safe with me -- but on the scale of dirty little secrets, I'd give it, say... a two. 
Mumford twists the headlamp and the light shines out in the dusk. Mumford turns the beam directly at Skip. 
MUMFORD You want to know a secret? I'll tell you a secret. Since it's just between us and all... 
Skip, hanging on every word now, agrees emphatically. 
MUMFORD The secret, Skip, is this -- I am not now, nor have I ever been... a psychologist. 
At first, Skip thinks he's misunderstood Mumford. But in the huge silence that ensues, he replays it and knows he's heard right. Mumford looks around, adjusts his headlamp, and gets up. 
MUMFORD We'd better get going. Just follow my light. And, Skip, watch your step. 
EXT. MUMFORD'S PORCH, THE DUPLEX HOUSE - NIGHT 
This porch is directly above Lily's porch. Mumford and Skip sit nursing beers. There's a cooler on the floor. Mumford's legs are propped up on the porch railing 
SKIP Who else knows? 
MUMFORD Just you. 
SKIP It's time you did some talkin', Dr. Mum -- Wait a minute. That is your name, isn't it? 
Mumford takes a drink of beer. 
A PROFESSOR approaches camera and lays a fresh examination on the desk in front of Mumford. The problem is -- Mumford is so doped up the classroom is swimming and the examination paper keeps changing shape. 
MUMFORD (V.O.) All that fun eventually had an impact on the work I was doing. I figured, what the hell, it was only college, after all. I'd straighten up when I went out in the real world... 
INT. OFFICE BUILDING CORRIDOR - NIGHT 
TIGHT ON SEVERAL AMPHETAMINE CAPSULES being dumped into Mumford's palm over a water fountain. They disappear toward camera as we dip down toward the stream of water. 
MUMFORD (V.O.) I didn't want to jump into my career right out of college. And since I had no career, that turned out to be not much of a problem... 
MUMFORD'S POV lifts from the fountain and turns to the endless, deserted corridor of the huge building. We begin TRACKING DOWN the hall, checking out the various doorways. A Cleaning Crew appears far up ahead. 
MUMFORD (V.O.) I had a series of challenging jobs over the next few years... 
EXT. ALLEY - DAY 
We PAN from the back of a garbage truck to a mess of garbage containers, and MOVE TOWARD THEM. 
INT. GAS STATION - NIGHT 
TIGHT ON TWO LINES of cocaine. We DIP TOWARD THEM, then UP AGAIN and they're gone. PAN to REVEAL we're in a closet off the brightly-lit office of an all-night gas station. A PATRON is waiting impatiently out by the pumps. 
EXT. SECOND FLOOR PORCH, THE DUPLEX HOUSE - NIGHT 
BACK TO PRESENT. Skip watches Mumford intently. 
MUMFORD ...pizza delivery, pipe fitting, pest control... lots of jobs that started with the letter "p". For some reason, I kept losing these jobs. (takes a swig of beer) The only mind-altering substance I never had a problem with was alcohol. I never got drunk. I didn't like the feeling. But really, when you're as fucked up as I was... big deal. 
Mumford stands up and stretches, then sits on the railing facing Skip. 
MUMFORD Eventually, doing all these different jobs, I noticed something. For some reason, probably because I was too stoned to talk, everywhere I went -- 
INT./EXT. SERIES OF SHOTS-- TALKING HEADS 
We see various CO-WORKERS from Mumford's jobs. The environments are radically different, but the activity is always the same -- the Co-Worker in question is pouring his heart out to camera. 
MUMFORD (V.O.) -- people would talk to me, tell me everything... their stories, their problems, their innermost thoughts. Sometimes they'd pretend they needed advice, but mostly people just wanted someone to listen. 
INT. CRAWLSPACE UNDER HOUSE - DAY 
MUMFORD'S MOVING POV as he crawls into the darkness, an insecticide sprayer ahead of him. He pushes at a cinderblock -- 
MUMFORD (V.O.) Anyway, one day I was spraying for termites when I had a vision -- 
The cinderblock tips over and a swarm of scary-looking spiders comes rushing out toward camera. 
MUMFORD (V.O.) -- it was time to put my college degree to work and get a job with a desk. 
SMASH CUT TO: 
INT. GOVERNMENT OFFICES - DAY 
FROM BEHIND A DESK in the middle of a huge sea of desks. 
MUMFORD (V.O.) I took the civil service exam and found myself working at the Internal Revenue Service, District 14, Central Administrative Office. I started off as a general records clerk... 
SERIES OF SHOTS: computer records scrolling rapidly, paper files being pulled, documents being routed. 
MUMFORD (V.O.) I guess the standards weren't too high there, because my superiors got excited and pushed me to take the advancement tests... 
INT. YMCA GYM - NIGHT 
An intense basketball game. The ball zips from behind camera (Mumford) to an older guy, MUMFORD'S SUPERVISOR, under the basket; he lays it in easily, then comes over to high-five. 
MUMFORD (V.O.) One guy in particular thought I should be a Revenue Officer. There was more money to be made as your classification went up. Which had a lot of appeal to me... 
INT. KITCHEN TABLE, MUMFORD'S CITY APARTMENT (PAST) - NIGHT 
A COCAINE MILL is loaded with white chunks and screwed shut in MUMFORD'S POV; the steady grinding begins. Spread across the messy kitchen table is the regular user's paraphernalia. 
MUMFORD (V.O.) ...since, even though I was certain I could stop anytime I wanted, I had developed a real affection for cocaine. It was my favorite hobby I had ever had. 
INT. INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE OFFICES - DAY 
MUMFORD'S POV SHIFTS around the office. First, he's looking at an irate TAXPAYER yelling across a desk at a REVENUE OFFICER, who remains unruffled -- 
MUMFORD (V.O.) But I sure didn't want to be a Revenue Officer, where you were face to face abusing -- and getting abused -- all day long... 
MUMFORD (V.O.) The way the District Managers got ahead and won their bonuses was by generating maximum payments. That meant the revenue officers had to use all their "collection tools" -- seizures, liens, levies -- even if a more reasonable compromise could have been worked out. The best way to reduce resistance from the taxpayers was to build a convincing case -- whether there'd actually been a violation or not... 
Mumford follows Gregory, crawling, to the edge of the roof and looks down on a building one block over. It is a small furniture factory. Employees are eating their lunches on the loading dock. 
MUMFORD (V.O.) That's where we came in. Our DM was a particular sonuvabitch, and he knew just how to get Gregory crazy. 
INT. ETHNIC RESTAURANT - NIGHT 
MUMFORD'S POV takes in his ATTRACTIVE DATE next to him, then PANS TO Candy and Gregory across the table. Everybody's laughing. Candy flashes Mumford a momentary special look. MUMFORD'S POV guiltily PANS TO Gregory. Did he see it? 
MUMFORD (V.O.) So several things were working on Gregory when we started building a case against a furniture maker named Edmond Worrell... 
EXT. PARKING LOT, FURNITURE FACTORY - MAGIC 
BINOCULAR VIEW of EDMOND WORRELL and MRS. WORRELL as they get in a Cadillac at the end of a workday. 
MUMFORD (V.O.) ...and his family. 
INT. BUSINESS OFFICE, WORRELL FURNITURE FACTORY - NIGHT 
Lit by powerful flashlights, Gregory and Mumford attack the files of the company, both in cabinets and on computer. 
MUMFORD (V.O.) Gregory was acting more and more irrational. We started doing things that were over the line even for the IRS. When I look back on it now, I'm sure Gregory must have known about Candy and me. On our team, I had become... 
INT. MEN'S ROOM, WORRELL FURNITURE FACTORY - NIGHT 
EXTREME CLOSE-UP A LINE OF COCAINE on the top of a toilet tank as it is sucked out of sight. 
MUMFORD (V.O.) ...the responsible one. 
INT. BEDROOM, MUMFORD'S CITY APARTMENT - DAY 
MUMFORD'S POV IS A BLURRY SHAPE until Candy moves up and away, her face sweaty and aroused, torso naked. She's on top of Mumford. 
INT. GOVERNMENT CAR - DAY 
Mumford's POV slides into the passenger seat. Gregory is already sitting in the driver's seat. He stares at Mumford a long time. 
INT. CORRIDOR, SHABBY OFFICE BUILDING - DAY 
Mumford is following Gregory and REVENUE OFFICER MCLURE down the hall. They reach a door with the painted sign: "SAMUEL GORBECK, C.P.A." 
MUMFORD (V.O.) Sometimes when a case didn't work out right, Gregory and this Revenue Officer named McLure would put the squeeze on the subject's accountant... 
As they start to enter, SOFT CUT TO: 
INT. GORBECK'S INNER OFFICE - DAY 
GORBECK listens, intimidated by McLure, who sits on the accountant's desk, and Gregory, who is moving around the office -- snooping. 
MUMFORD (V.O.) There aren't many accountants who don't have something to worry about with the Service... 
INT. IRS OFFICES - DAY 
Edmond Worrell, his wife, his adult SON and DAUGHTER, WORRELL'S LAWYER, and, finally, the accountant Gorbeck are ushered toward a conference room by McLure, Gregory and some other IRS types. Gorbeck sneaks a nervous look at Mumford. Gregory, who now appears slightly mad, motions for Mumford to join them. 
MUMFORD (V.O.) The parties met repeatedly over a period of months. The IRS offered to settle for a sizable but, they said, fair amount. Worrell said he'd done nothing wrong and threatened to fight it all the way to Washington. He seemed pretty strong. I was secretly pulling for him. McLure and the District Manager stepped up the pressure. 
EXT. PARKING LOT, WORRELL FURNITURE FACTORY - DAY 
MOVING POV OUT THE WINDSHIELD of Gregory's government car as it comes speeding into the parking lot. There are two flashing Squad Cars and an Ambulance at the entrance. As Gregory's car hits a speedbump, the IMAGE BEGINS TO SLOW DOWN -- 
MUMFORD (V.O.) What none of us down at the Service knew was that Edmond Worrell had a story too... Worrell's was that he'd been fighting chronic depression for thirty years. Under the heat of the investigation, he fell off his medication. One Tuesday morning, he went down to the factory early, wrote his family a letter, then used the 9mm automatic they kept there to kill himself... The DM dropped the case that day and started proceedings to get rid of Gregory... 
The IMAGE HAS SLOWED TO A STILL. It now DISSOLVES TO: 
EXT. GREGORY'S HOUSE, CITY STREET - NIGHT 
Mumford's POV as he comes up the steps. The front door opens before he gets there. Candy, her face bruised, her eyes red, comes into view, she has a suitcase in hand. 
MUMFORD (V.O.) Gregory went home drunk, beat up Candy and went out to drink some more. Candy told me she didn't want to see me again. She hated us both and she was leaving us both... It made perfect sense to me. I felt the same way... 
INT. BEDROOM, MUMFORD'S CITY APARTMENT - NIGHT 
Mumford is frantically, futilely looking for an imagined drug stash. He's ransacked the place and is now throwing the clothes out of a drawer. 
INT. BATHROOM, MUMFORD'S CITY APARTMENT - NIGHT 
A STACK OF BOOKS. The ones on top are lifted away. The bottom book is opened to reveal the birth certificate. It has been folded in an official way. Now Mumford unfolds it, then refolds it differently -- with its smudges and creases, it's starting to look old. 
SKIP (V.O.) And a birth certificate is enough? 
MUMFORD (V.O.) Everything flows from that, and what doesn't... can be easily purchased. 
SERIES OF SHOTS of Mumford's DOCUMENTATION PILING UP. A post office box is emptied, official-looking correspondence is opened, the bounty is laid out for perusal: Social Security card, driver's license, college and graduate school diplomas, license and accreditation to operate as a therapist. 
MUMFORD (V.O.) Of course, my IRS training made it easier. Once you've done that, there's not much data you can't access and use any way you want. 
EXT. SECOND FLOOR PORCH, THE DUPLEX HOUSE - NIGHT 
MUMFORD In a free society, you are who you say you are. (smiling) People should remember that before they go around knocking this country. (he gets up) Skip, all this beer's got me sleepy. 
Skip looks upset. 
SKIP But you studied psychology, right? You did the training and just never got the degree? 
MUMFORD No... no training. 
SKIP (hopeful) Psych major? 
MUMFORD English Lit. 
SKIP Jeez, man. But you're good at it! 
MUMFORD I understand what it's like to want to leave a problem behind. That's all most people are looking to do. (shrugs) Mainly, I listen. 
He heads inside. 
SKIP Where ya going? I've got a million questions. 
MUMFORD See you Thursday... regular time. 
Mumford goes inside. Skip nods, head spinning. 
EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD STREET - SUNRISE 
Mumford and Sofie are delivering newspapers in lovely first light. Mumford has a canvas sack full of newspapers around his neck. At each house, he consults the list in his hand, then hands Sofie a rolled-up paper, which she throws -- with varying success -- toward the front doors. The activity is tiring for her, but she's committed. 
SOFIE ...so we get on this incredible steam engine train that runs up into the mountains... (she tosses a paper, grunting) ...and this trip is everything it's cracked up to be... an open car, great views, the mountain air blowing through. We're sitting there, married for six years, and he says how he likes it better when I put my hair back... 
Mumford hands her another paper, which she heaves with all her limited strength, missing the front porch badly. Mumford, who can't get enough of watching her, doesn't notice at first. 
SOFIE That wasn't so good. 
Mumford snaps out of it. He goes up on the lawn and flips the paper deftly onto the porch. As they continue -- 
MUMFORD You're doing great. 
SOFIE I don't know if I'm going to make it the whole way. 
MUMFORD It doesn't matter. Go on. 
SOFIE Oh... this makes me sound irrational, which is probably right, but there was something about him saying this -- it was maybe the millionth time he'd told me about some preference of his. Well, I was so... tired of it. (memories) Seems like my whole life someone's been telling me... I'm just not getting it right. Can we rest for a second? 
She leans against the iron handrail on some front steps, breathing hard. 
SOFIE You're purposely making me talk while we do this... (Mumford nods) ...because you think this is good for me... (nods again) ...and you're a sadistic bastard... 
MUMFORD Yes. 
SOFIE ...who thinks there's nothing really wrong with me. 
MUMFORD Oh, there's something wrong with you, all right. Especially after hearing that dream of yours, about the Roto-Rooter. 
She laughs. They're playing with each other. 
SOFIE That was really bad, wasn't it? 
MUMFORD Disgusting. 
SOFIE And I'll bet you can interpret the whole thing 
MUMFORD It's pretty obvious to a trained professional. 
Sofie starts walking again, taking another newspaper from his sack. He points to the next house. 
NESSA (after a beat) No. I don't know what he wants. But I know I don't like being watched. Nobody's ever paid any attention to what I did, and I liked it just fine. Where does he get off telling me I disrespect myself? (a beat) Fuck him. Look in a mirror, bozo. 
EXT. LILY'S CAFÉ, MAIN STREET - DAY 
Mumford crosses the street from his office. A huge bus with "APPLEJACK TOURS" on the sides, is disgorging its passengers, a large group of elderly JAPANESE WOMEN, all of whom file neatly into Lily's Café. Lily stands on the sidewalk outside greeting them merrily. 
MUMFORD What's the deal? 
Lily continues her welcomes, but points out a hand-lettered sign in her front window -- "Closed for Lunch. See you tomorrow." 
LILY They come through a few times each year. (greeting one cheerily) Hello, Mrs. Saito, good to see you again! (back to Mumford) It's a tour. 
MUMFORD Where am I supposed to eat? 
LILY You're on your own today, honey. 
Mumford's attention is suddenly drawn to something across the street. He glances thoughtfully at Lily for a moment, then back out there. 
WHAT HE SEES: Skip is once again zipping down the street on his skateboard in the midst of traffic. He has not noticed Mumford. 
MUMFORD (O.S.) Hey, Skip! 
Skip looks over, then immediately changes course toward them, barely checking the surrounding traffic. He is extraordinarily skillful. When he gets to the curb, he pulls a snazzy board- flipping maneuver to dismount and come up on the sidewalk. Some of the Japanese matrons react with delight. 
SKIP Doc. 
Skip notices the tour members filing by, but is immediately distracted by the presence of Lily, who's a little excited to meet the local celebrity. 
MUMFORD Lily, I want you to meet Skip. Skip, Lily. 
LILY It's a pleasure to meet you. 
SKIP (flustered) Yeah... me you, too... I was at your house... 
LILY Oh? 
SKIP Upstairs, with Doc... Yeah, it's very nice... I heard your shower. 
Skip can't believe what he just said. Neither can the other two, actually. Mumford can't stop himself from laughing, but he cuts it off fast. Lily blushes, but Skip's agitation has charmed her. Something's happening here. 
LILY I've seen you going by on your board, but I didn't realize -- you're so young... to be so... 
SKIP What? 
MUMFORD ...so rich? 
LILY (gives him a look) ...so accomplished. 
SKIP I may be young, but Doc can tell you, I'm very immature. 
He's making a joke and it represents quite a recovery. They're all relieved. Then there's an awkward silence. Skip watches the last of the tour enter the restaurant. 
SKIP So, is this like a Japanese restaurant? 
LILY I'd better get in there. 
SKIP That's a lot of people all at once. 
LILY It's okay. They pre-order. There's a choice of three entrees. 
SKIP What are they? 
Lily gives him a careful look: Is he really interested? There's something about him... 
LILY Meat loaf, turkey quesadillas, or salad nicoise. 
SKIP Salad nicoise? I love salad nicoise. 
LILY (giggling) You do? 
SKIP Yeah. 
LILY Well, come on in. 
She motions him in and starts to follow. Mumford makes a "what about me?" sound. Lily, grinning, just points to the sign and leaves Mumford standing on the sidewalk. 
DELBANCO (O.S.) Dr. Mumford. 
SHEELER Yes... your particular approach. 
MUMFORD I don't have one really. Most of the time I'm faking it. See, I think there's not much that can be done about most problems... they're too complicated, too deep-rooted by the time I hear about them. The most I can do, usually, is look and listen real closely, try to catch some glimpse of the secret life everybody's got. If I can get a sense of that, well then, maybe... just maybe, I can help them out a little. 
Mumford sits back, considering the couple across the table. His gaze is so crystalline that, after a moment, they become uncomfortable and steal a glance at each other. Finally -- 
DELBANCO I see. 
INT. MUMFORD'S OFFICE - DAY 
CLOSE ON Althea Brockett. 
ALTHEA -- The argument had nothing to do with it. 
MUMFORD (O.S.) I understand. I just want to know what the argument was about. 
ALTHEA (hates to say) I had ordered some books. "The 100 Greatest Books Ever Written." 
MUMFORD (O.S.) Uh-huh. What are they? 
ALTHEA Oh, all the great writers -- Shakespeare, Charles Dickens, Moby Dick... those people. Each is bound in genuine premium leather with 22 carat gold accents. It's a magnificent set -- and only $33.50 per volume. Right away you get Great Expectations for just $6.99. 
MUMFORD (O.S.) One hundred books? 
ALTHEA It's irrelevant. It had nothing to do with what happened. 
MUMFORD (O.S.) What happened? 
Althea is sitting on the couch facing Mumford. She has a bulky knit cardigan sweater hugged tightly around her -- the only sign that she's not completely calm. 
ALTHEA We argued on Sunday. He went to work on Monday and stayed in the city during the week, like always. But on Thursday, when he normally comes home, he didn't. Didn't call either. Not till Saturday afternoon. 
MUMFORD You must have been concerned. 
ALTHEA It's happened before. (a beat) I'm shocked by how little I'm feeling. I can't understand it. (a real question --) I'll probably have a complete depressoid collapse soon, won't I? 
MUMFORD Doubtful. What did he say? 
ALTHEA He said he wasn't coming back. He said it wasn't working for him any more. That it hadn't "worked for him" for quite a while... You know what I regret the most? I'm sorry I let him make the kids take his name. He was an acquirer. (off Mumford's look) He liked to acquire things. 
Mumford looks away. Althea realizes what he's thinking. 
ALTHEA You think that has something to do with my problem? Ordering all those things?... 
It hadn't occurred to Mumford, but it's an interesting thought. 
ALTHEA ...Like I was on some kind of campaign to out-acquire him... (excited now, playing it out) ...If I was just an acquisition to him, and he lost interest once he had me -- 
She stops, shakes her head. 
ALTHEA That can't be it. It's too simple. And besides, I still like it. This morning I ordered a marble turtle cheese board from The Horchow Collection. (an odd look) Can I tell you something just awful? You know how people who are just assholes will sometimes look at a woman who's got problems and say, "What she needs is a good shtupping!"? 
Mumford nods. 
ALTHEA Well, there may be something to that. Jeremy didn't keep up his end -- Oh, what difference does it make? (suddenly) Why do I feel elated? Am I in denial? You know what it feels like?... 
She glances at her watch, then starts talking fast -- 
ALTHEA I know my time's up, but I've got to get this out while I've got hold of it -- 
MUMFORD Take your time. 
ALTHEA (no slowing down) -- When I was in high school, the thing I wanted most, when I was stuck in class, the thing I was always desperately in pursuit of -- was a hall pass. That's all I wanted. I loved moving freely around the school while everybody else was trapped in there... And that's how I feel right now... Like I have some giant, all- day hall pass. 
She is beaming, but suddenly becomes self-conscious. She stands up abruptly, flushed. 
ALTHEA My god, did it just get hot in here or what? 
She takes off the bulky sweater and bends to pick up her purse. She is wearing a simple cotton dress that buttons up the front and hugs her body. WE SEE for the first time what all her other outfits have hidden: Althea has a terrific, voluptuous figure. 
ALTHEA See you next time. I'll probably be a basket case by then. 
She heads toward the door to the waiting room. Mumford indicates the back door. 
MUMFORD You can go out there if you like... 
ALTHEA (quoting Mumford) "There's no shame in getting a little therapy", right, Doc? 
MUMFORD Really? 
SKIP It's all your fault. In the last 48 hours, I've completely lost interest. 
MUMFORD What'd I do? 
Skip looks at Mumford, a wide grin on his face. 
SKIP Lily. 
MUMFORD Lily... (gets it) ...Skip, that's great! You and Lily. 
SKIP Oh, she doesn't know about it yet. Right now, of the two of us, I'm the only one in love. But I'm very stoked. 
Skip settles in front of the Body Parts section, framed by an array of limbs and sex toys. There's an assembled pelvic section with upper legs lying in the clutter behind him. 
SKIP Doc, how I can be of help to you? 
Skip leans back against the table and accidentally hits a button. The pelvic section begins to hump, slowly and sensually, in place. It's amazingly life-like, but it makes a mechanical WHIRRING SOUND. Skip fumbles to turn it off. 
SKIP Sorry... 
MUMFORD Wow. 
Skip gets the pelvis switched off and turns back to Mumford. 
SKIP I'm here for you, Doc. 
MUMFORD Skip, you know that it's improper -- completely unethical -- for a licensed psychologist to carry on a romantic relationship with one of his patients? 
SKIP I guess that makes sense. 
MUMFORD Yes, yes it does... 
Mumford sinks into silence. He begins to wander the room. 
SKIP You've fallen in love with one of your patients? 
Mumford nods. Skip is desperate to say something useful. Suddenly, he has an alarming thought. 
SKIP Doc!... It's not me, is it? 
MUMFORD What? 
Mumford understands and can't stop a laugh. 
MUMFORD No, Skip, it's not you. But I like you a lot. 
Skip is relieved. He has another thought and brightens. 
SKIP Doc, what about this? You're not really a licensed psychologist! 
Mumford turns to meet Skip's gaze. Skip realizes the ramifications of what he's just said. 
SKIP Hmm. I guess that doesn't help... I see where you're going here. It's a mess. 
MUMFORD Yep. 
INT. DR. DELBANCO'S OFFICE - DAY 
Lionel is here with Delbanco and Sheeler. This time, Delbanco is behind his desk, Sheeler across the room on the sofa. 
LIONEL Don't you find it incredibly convenient that everyone who could possibly corroborate his story has recently died some exotic death? 
DELBANCO They're neither all recent nor exotic. 
SHEELER But they're certainly dead. And yes, personally, I find it a bit odd. 
DELBANCO It could happen. What about his state certification exams? The records seem to be in order. 
Lionel's derisive snort is so obnoxious, it's hard to bear. 
LIONEL What's easier than hacking your way into a state computer and inserting some numbers? For all you know he never even took the exams! 
SHEELER That's true. 
DELBANCO I don't know that it's all that easy... 
MRS. COOK Keep it zipped, Ben. 
Ben gives Mumford an exasperated look, but doesn't argue. 
MR. COOK Is there something we need to know, Dr. Mumford? 
Mumford is conflicted, not sure what to share with them. 
MUMFORD Well... yes, I guess I should tell you. I don't think I'm going to be able to treat Sofie anymore. 
Mr. Cook and Ben exchange an alarmed glance. Mrs. Cook actually cheers up. 
MRS. COOK Finally, some common sense... 
MUMFORD What do you mean? 
MRS. COOK I think you know what I mean. 
MUMFORD No, I really don't. 
MRS. COOK I think you do. 
MUMFORD Why don't you tell me? 
MRS. COOK (very calm) Why don't you go to hell? It's all a bunch of nonsense and you know it. 
MR. COOK Elizabeth, I'm tellin' you, stop this... 
MRS. COOK (dismissive) You're telling me? That's rich... 
MUMFORD (standing up) I'd better go. 
BEN Why can't you see Sofie? I know the treatment's working. 
Mumford looks from Ben to Mr. Cook, who nods his agreement. 
MUMFORD Well... you see, the problem is -- 
MRS. COOK -- the problem is you're a big fake. You haven't got a clue what's wrong with that girl. 
Mumford looks at Mrs. Cook and can't stifle a laugh. 
MUMFORD Wow. You're something. 
MRS. COOK Take a hike, Dr. Quack! 
MR. COOK (ignoring her now) What is the problem, Doctor? 
Mumford can't take his eyes off Mrs. Cook, even as he speaks to Mr. Cook. 
MUMFORD Problem? I guess there is no problem... Uh, this friend of Sofie's, where'd he take her? 
BEN It's she -- Roxy. Used to work with her. I think they went over to The Lantern. 
MUMFORD (delighted) Oh, Roxy! Excellent. Roxy. 
Mrs. Cook looks at him sharply. She's heard what the other two have not. 
EXT. SIDE STREET/ALLEY - DAY 
Mumford carries a large Fed-Ex box down a side street and into an alley. As he passes a secluded space created by two adjacent buildings, something catches his eye. 
MUMFORD'S MOVING POV: A young couple is embracing and talking intimately. As they separate, we can see that it is Nessa and Martin Brockett. Martin sees Mumford, but makes no sign. Nessa twists to see what Martin's looking at just as the view is interrupted by a wall. 
Mumford walks on, mulling what he's seen. 
EXT. BACK DOOR, FOLLETT'S PHARMACY - DAY 
There is a locked security screen at the alley entrance to the back room of the pharmacy, but the door inside is open. When a YOUNG PHARMACIST appears in there, Mumford raps on the metal screen. 
INT. HENRY FOLLETT'S OFFICE - DAY 
Follett's private space is above and at the back of his drugstore. When you sit at his desk and in front of it, as Follett and Mumford are doing now, you can see down into the store through a floor-to-ceiling, one-way mirror. 
The Fed-Ex box sits on the desk between the two men, unopened. 
FOLLETT What is it? 
EXT. HIKING TRAIL - DAY 
Mumford and Sofie make their way slowly up the trail. Despite her labored breathing, it's clear Sofie has made enormous progress since we first saw her. 
SOFIE When I was in high school we used to come up here and make out. I liked to sit on the rock and watch the sun go down. 
MUMFORD That's what I like. 
SOFIE Which thing? 
MUMFORD Either one. 
SOFIE Why'd you come to the house the other night? 
MUMFORD I thought I had something to tell you. But it turned out I didn't. 
SOFIE My brother said you were about to fire me. 
MUMFORD That's one way to put it. 
SOFIE I bet I know what changed your mind... (Mumford looks at her) ...My mother. She was so horrible, you decided you couldn't desert me. 
MUMFORD I thought only action movies had villains like that. 
Sofie gestures ahead. 
SOFIE That's the cut-off, isn't it? (Mumford nods) I know why you were going to quit seeing me. 
Mumford slows at this. Sofie heads off the trail into the woods. 
EXT. BIG ROCK LOOKOUT POINT - DAY 
Sofie appears first, but she waits for Mumford before she steps tentatively onto the rock. Mumford takes firm hold of her and leads her to a spot where she can securely settle herself. 
SOFIE You feel like a fake, an imposter... 
Mumford looks up, sharply. 
SOFIE ...as if maybe you don't know what you're doing. 
She puts a hand on his arm. 
SOFIE Everybody feels that way sometimes... like we're not who we're supposed to be. But I have to tell you, Dr. Mumford -- 
He winces at her formality. 
SOFIE -- you've been a tremendous help to me. 
MUMFORD Yeah? 
SOFIE I can't tell you how much I admire you. You have a wonderful way with people. And you're very insightful. I feel like you've seen me clearly... I never used to admit what a horrible person my mother was. You've made that possible for me. 
MUMFORD That's... good? 
SOFIE Yes! And my ex-husband -- he never accepted me for who I was, just like Mother. The things you've said have helped me understand what a dick he is. 
MUMFORD I don't know if -- 
SOFIE You're shockingly honest, that's what makes you great. I've never had a man treat me this way. With you, I feel really... listened to. (gives him a look) Can I tell you something? It's a little embarrassing, but I feel very unguarded with you. 
MUMFORD Of course. 
SOFIE Thanks to this therapy, I now know what I'm looking for. I need to find a man like you. (laughs) Not one who's treating me, of course. (full of resolve) And I'm going to do it, dammit! You've given me the confidence. 
Mumford is in agony. 
MUMFORD Sofie... that makes me very happy. 
INT. MUMFORD'S OFFICE - DAY 
Nessa's on the couch, playing with her usual unlit cigarette. There's an uncharacteristic lightness to her. 
NESSA ...I mean, Doc, the dude is seriously deluded. I said that to him, I said, "If you think I'm gonna do all that shit for you, man, you are seriously deluded." 
MUMFORD What'd he say? 
NESSA (can't hide her pleasure) He said -- "Which we already knew!" 
Suddenly, Sofie's voice cracks. She is starting to cry, but refuses to acknowledge it. 
SOFIE -- We had a paper route together, for godssake! Do you understand how I might be a little resentful? Knowing that this so-called "love" I'm feeling is totally bogus, and just a pathetic case of... transference? 
Mumford doesn't know what to say. He's on the rack. Finally -- 
MUMFORD Yes. 
Silence. Then Sofie gets up, wiping at tears with the back of her bare hand. Mumford jumps up to offer her a tissue, but she ignores it. She will not meet his gaze. 
SOFIE Maybe you ought to think about how you're going to fix this. And when you do... (suddenly losing her will) ...please get back to me. 
Sofie turns to go out through the waiting room, but after a step, she stops, pirouettes and goes out the back. 
EXT. THE DUPLEX HOUSE - MAGIC 
Mumford comes up the street, lost in thought, and turns into the driveway toward his stairs. Ainge leaps over the front yard fence. Mumford pets the dog distractedly, still moving. 
MUMFORD Hey, Ainge. 
Lily rises up suddenly from where she's been working in the garden. 
LILY Doc... 
MUMFORD (keeps walking) Lily. 
LILY Doc. 
Mumford reluctantly stops. Lily comes up to the fence. 
LILY I don't want you to be mad at Skip... 
MUMFORD He told you. 
LILY (yes) Skip and I wouldn't have got together if it weren't for you. That's a big deal. 
MUMFORD (dismisses it) You would have met in some shower eventually... 
LILY I want to give you something. Will you let me? 
MUMFORD Thanks, Lily, I don't need anything. 
LILY Yes, you do, you damn well do. 
MUMFORD (can't fight) Okay. 
LILY Here it is, some advice -- do the hard thing. 
MUMFORD That's it? That's what you're giving me? 
LILY Clean up the mess. No matter what it takes. 
Mumford leans down to pet Ainge. 
MUMFORD What it might take is... doing time. 
LILY Too bad. That's tough, I mean it. I'm not unsympathetic. But Skip says you're in love. 
Mumford straightens, looks at Lily and acknowledges it. 
LILY Then it's worth it. 
Mumford looks at Lily a long moment, then leans over the fence and kisses her on the forehead. Ainge jumps back over to her side. 
MUMFORD I'll tell her tonight. 
Mumford turns and continues toward his stairs. 
INT. MUMFORD'S APARTMENT - MAGIC 
Mumford comes in, drops his coat, gets a carton of orange juice out of the fridge and drinks directly from it. Distracted, he picks up the remote from the kitchen counter and switches on the TV, then opens his freezer and stares inside. 
UNSOLVED MYSTERIES comes on. The opening segment previews a story about a couple who claim to have had a visitation from Gianni Versace, then one about a yacht that went down near Venezuela. ROBERT STACK, in his characteristic fragmented delivery, intones the preview for the last story, accompanied by appropriate footage: 
ROBERT STACK ...A drug rehabilitation center in the lonely southwestern desert... run by reclusive monks... becomes the point of departure in a mysterious vanishing...
